I hate trying on clothes and refuse to put my regular outfit back on, only to remove it 2 minutes later. No way. So I told her she could keep the rest.

I'm not sure if he has a disability or not but he is extremely rude to the employees.

He started shouting, Oh my god! Why haven't you taken your break! He was out of line! All of us were just wondering how they can put up with him. \n\nNext, as she was going on her break he told her since she was headed in a direction where they put returns he told her to take the cart with her and then proceeded to add more crates to it....

They claim to be the only sports bar in the area, and while I'm not sure if that's technically true, they do have a ton of TVs, so it would be a great place to catch a game (if you can afford to stay here for 2-3 hours and drink...more on that in a sec). \n\nThe restaurant itself is open, clean and bright (but not too bright), and the decor is modern and sleek (love the metal Pittsburgh sports logo art adorning the walls). They did a really nice job updating the dark and noir feeling of the space's previous tenant (Marisqueira). \n\nThe menu is pretty standard bar fare (burgers, wings, sandwiches), with some more substantial dinner options thrown in (pastas, fish entrees). They did a good job not overlapping their menu options too much with the bar a few doors down (Sam's Tavern). The beer selection is not particularly impressive or expansive for a bar, but it'll probably suit most people just fine. On our recent visit here, I opted for some good ol' chicken fingers and fries, while my husband got the Italian Stallion burger. The food was good, but nothing noteworthy. The chicken tenders were the exact same generic frozen-from-a-bag variety that I've gotten other places a million times before. I did really enjoy the fries...they seemed to be fresh cut and were very well seasoned. My husband liked his burger, but again, thought it was \"just a burger.\" Good, but not great. And that's exactly what I would expect at a sports bar, so I really can't complain about the food. Service was fast and friendly, so I also can't complain about the service.\n\nThe problem is the prices. I have no idea why a lot of places in Aspinwall seem to be overpriced. I don't know if it is its proximity to Fox Chapel, which makes business owners think patrons will be willing to pay more. I don't know if it's the fact that Aspinwall is not a huge neighborhood, and thus lower volume necessitates higher pricing. But at Ordinary Joe's, I felt like everything was priced about 20% too high for what you got. I mean, my chicken tenders and fries were $10. I don't even know if they even charge that much for chicken tenders at PNC Park, haha. My husband's burger was $11 (and he can get a better burger at Burgatory for that same price). And $4 for a bottle of Labatt's? During a Pens game, no less? I mean, if you call yourself a sports bar, I think you should probably have drink specials during the games....that's a pretty standard move for most sports bars. Because otherwise, at $4 a bottle for a fairly crappy beer, there is no way I'm hanging around for 2-3 hours and drinking there while I watch a game.\n\nI may give Ordinary Joe's another try sometime, particularly if they decide to start offering drink specials during games, but I'm not going to be rushing back there. 3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MVIFPx1kRXlSGBNzm4vPiQ"}

This is their second location and I am happy it is so close to home. This is the first time I've tried Tortilla Fish and now I am hooked  \nOur order included battered fish tacos, a Barbacoa beef taco, shrimp quesadilla, steak quesadilla, rice and beans. Everything comes undressed so you can wild out at the salsa bar. Everything you could ever want on your taco or quesadilla! The fish by itself is melt in your mouth. The shrimp tastes fresh and not like salad shrimps. The Barbacoa is tender and juicy like a pot roast. \nOnly thing is the tables are tight if the place is busy which it was and I assume it will always be.

A fish Taco that is solely just fish and a tortilla. This place is pathetic, and they wanted $8.99 FOR TWO?!?!\n\nI went back in after eating one of the tacos, and the manager was kind enough to refund me for the two I didn't eat. I bumped up to 3 stars for service.\n\nTortilla fish should revisit the recipe because the fish, and the presentation of the fish (with obscene large chunks, as a result of no effort in cutting these, that have no choice to fall out or punch through the tortilla), were soggy and flavorless. The tortilla shells were mushy and when I put the salsa on they immediately soaked in the salsa and broke apart at the first bite. I believe that both the fish and tortilla are frozen and packaged because fresh made don't do that.\n\nI understand that they do have a topping bar, but it doesn't matter when the toppings can't fit on the Fish Taco because of the large chunks. The toppings also appear to be canned products based on their taste, and my experience with LA Taco trucks having the same toppings (and nothing is fresh on a Taco truck). I would be shocked if these were prepared fresh.\n\nBecause commentors inspired me to elaborate on my experience - In retrospect, I don't think 3 stars is deserving. I would rate 1, but the service was okay.", "type": "review", "business_id": "p9FwRY_KnxEHSI5op2qOvw"}

Arcades were dying in Vegas, but seem to be making a come back. This arcade is what we needed to keep arcades alive here.\n\nGame Nest made a good first impression to me. As soon as I came in there was a black marker board hanging on the front counter with neon ink. Its said \"Rules: No game hogging, be polite, and no bullying.\" Since arcades are starting to sprout and most adult's experience with arcades is from a hybrid of a bar and arcade, the rules being there is imperitive to those with no experience of ettiquite. Its nice to go to an arcade trying to enforce and push these rules.\n\nThe way the arcade works is that you can buy hourly passes or an all day pass. There was a sale for $5 per hour and $10 per hour and my plan was to stay there for 2 hours (I didnt, I stood way longer since I was having a blast), so naturally I got the all day.\n\nMy plan was to play Initial D mostly while taking small breaks with other machines and maybe burn a few cigarettes outside. I asked if they had Initial D cards and they did. The price for one was $1.50(for Black Friday, now its $2.25). Worth getting in my opinion as its a nice companion to my Jubeat card I got from So Good. The guy helped me set it up, and then I played Initial D. The arcade was empty, so I sat there playing for a while until a couple more people showed up. After I saw them I hadnt realized I already played for about an hour, so I went around looking for other machines.\n\nAs I looked around I saw quite a few different machines. Puzzle, fighting, lightguns, pinball, and even a Neo Geo machine. The Neo Geo machine had a good amount of games on it. I booted up Metal Slug and went for a few lives. There were a couple japanese games that i cant remember the names of. One was a crazy shooter (similar to Touhou) and the other was a puzzle game similar to Puzzle Bobble, but you pulled the bubbles down and shot them to match the colors. Both were lots of fun and I wanna try to get the highest score for both of them. The variety of fighting games are nice. You have old titles like Super Street Fighter 2 all the way to current titles like Mortal Kombat X. Other note worthy fightan gaems were Tekken 2, BlazBlue Continuum Shift, and Marvel vs. Capcom. The light games were House of the Dead 3, CarnEvil, and Virtua Cop. There are more light gun games, but they were a bit finniky with the aim. The was House of the Dead 2. The aim on House of the Dead was almost there, but still enough for me to suffer like G did. The racing games were some Daytona stock car game and Initial D3 (both able to take up to 2 players). Pinball machines were Shaq (my favorite), Street Fighter, a cowboy one, and I think thats all, but I could be missing one or two. Keep in mind there might be at least one pinball game thats down, but Shaq Attack, and Street Fighter 2 seem to be up regularly.\n\nI played around hopping back and forth from one machine to another. I felt a bit hungry, but not that hungry. I was going to go out and come back. Youre able to leave the property and come back in if you have the all day pass. The front desk of the place had prices for drinks and snacks. I just got a 7Up and took a break outside. I came back in, went to Initial D and played. By this time I had played for about 3 hours. I was pretty surprised that time flew by so fast. It was time for me to leave and I managed to get 2nd place on Miyoga with an under 3 minute time.\n\nI was about to leave and saw Splatoon on the screen. I was afraid that console play was seperated from the machines on my all day pass, but two guys told me to just go ahead. I suppose your pass also includes console play. I sat and played a round of Splatoon, but only after I changed the gender from boy to superior squid loli. I lost the match with the first gun and was on top of the team leaderboard, but i had an entire team of rollers so it was expected. I left, said goodbyes to the guy at the front desk and was off planning my next visit.\n\nThe they had all of the most current generation consoles, but Im not sure what games they have. I know they have Smash, Mario Kart 8, Splatoon, GTAV, Fallout 4, Halo 5 (?), and Black Ops 3 (?).\n\nThis place is just perfect and helps contribute to the revival of old arcades. This may be the closest arcade to arcades you'll see in Japan, though its only one floor with no UFO machines.\n\nIll edit this on my 3rd visit to confirm the games, add more detail on the list of machines, and the prices for other stuff like snacks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "632ekZEaCqxCz7G4ah_5rg"}

I would like to see more of the valley's heavyweights at this event (i.e. Cibo, Pomo, Bianco, etc) but a decent lineup for an inaugural event.  Some of the names that were here are well known while others were clearly using this event as a springboard.  The event certainly had room to grow on a number of fronts, but overall the first time was okay.\n\nThe inaugural Pizza fest was held at Civic Space Park downtown, which was an awesome setup in my opinion.  Its right on the light rail, steps away from ASU's downtown campus for all those hungry college kids, and spacious enough to accommodate all the vendors (both Pizza & otherwise) this first time around.  I counted ten pizza vendors this first time as well as over a dozen vendors of other products including beer, wine, & other miscellaneous stuff.  I got here at the 11am opening & was shocked to see so few people in line (especially given that this event sold out days before).  It worked out great for me as I was able to hit up each station with little or no line (though it got a lot busier after Noon).  There was live music in the main amphitheater stage as well as a kid zone & game area with corn hole stations, supersized versions of Connect Four, & even supersized Jenga.  But this is a Pizza festival after all, & I came for pies.\n\nThe event was advertised as $2 slices per station, but that was not at all the case.  Some stations offered $2 slices while others offered $4 sample whole pies, while others said whole pies only and on and on.  Festival organizers might wanna get their pizza vendors on the same page next time.  Additionally, it would be nicer to pay for pizza tokens or sample tickets in advance rather than everyone digging through their wallets for cash.  Most of the vendors I saw had Square for credit card transactions, but not all of them.  The event did a good job keeping ample ATMs on hand, but perhaps sell pizza ticket samples next year to sample all the pizza vendors.  Just a thought.\n\nAlright, to the the pizza.  I was able to wolf down pieces of pizza from six of the vendors this go around.  The vendors I went with this time:  Focoso, Charred, Il Bosco, Fabio on Fire, Dough Mama, & Saffron Jak.  I avoided pizza samples that had pepperoni &/or mushrooms so that somewhat limited my sampling options in spots.  Overall, I felt the pizza food trucks served up a better pie than the non-food truck pizza vendors (probably because the food trucks are used to serving large crowds on the fly).\n\nFirst, Focoso.  The only $2 pizza sample they were doing here was their margherita.  It was a normal medium sized slice & paper thin, but didn't have nearly enough cheese for my liking. Next up, Charred.  The were only offering 8\" mini pies for $7 so no cheaper samples here.  That said, I got their Mr White pizza & was super impressed.  Ricotta, mozzarella, pesto, basil, & roasted garlic.  Fantastic pie.  Next, Il Bosco.  I've heard great things about their restaurant in Scottsdale so I was excited for this one.  Unfortunately, the $2 margherita sample here was pretty average.  Tasted slightly undercooked as the dough didn't have that crunch I was looking for.  Hopefully their restaurant will turn out to be more worthy of the hype.  Next, Fabio on Fire's $3 margherita slice.  Slightly better than Il Bosco's as the crust was cooked through & there were nice chunks of mozzarella.  That said, the slice was almost room temperature so it may have been sitting there awhile.  Next, Dough Mama's $4 sample pesto mini pie.  Mozzarella, tomato, pesto, garlic, basil, & a touch of parmesan.  Great taste profile except for a woefully undercooked crust.  The crust was super soft to the point where it was tough to separate the slices.  Finally, I went with Saffron Jak's $2 sample.  A tiny mini pizza called the Full Monte.  Jak's stands out for a couple of reasons.  For one, the Full Monte has pork, chicken, bacon,& mozzarella.  The second was that their pizza bread is more like a flatbread (apparently a Persian twist on pizza).  It was a tiny piece, but it was definitely loaded with meat.  It was good, just a different twist.\n\nI was stuffed when all was said and done.  All together I spent $10 on admission and a little over $20 once I got there.  I didn't get any booze, but I did get a bottled water.  I left after hanging out for a couple hours, but was allowed to re-enter if I wanted to after my hand got stamped.  Overall, a good start for this inaugural event and a great outdoor space to showcase it.  The pizzas I had don't quite stack up to the Pomos or the Biancos or Cibos of the world (at least not in my opinion).  But I will say that I have a newfound respect for the valley's pizza food truck scene.  The food trucks shined over the pizza restaurants at this year's festival and I'll know which ones to look out for going forward.  Looking forward to trying the event again next year & hope the big dogs in the valley pizza scene join the party.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oMGhGXF_qCpM-eZSyfjOgw"}

The lines were long shortly after opening at this sold out event, but that was to be expected with a popular food such as pizza. \n\nThere was some great pizza, some not so great, so some was fresh and tasty, some was piping hot, some was cold and old. It would be nice to have more places to sit and enjoy the band or the company of friends and libations while eating pizza, sipping beer and wine and having ice cream or shaved ice. However, there were many happy faces, and the outdoor games were a nice touch. \n\nThe festival had a good mix of vendors and it was not too bad for an inaugural event. Next year the kinks should be worked out and vendors will be better prepared. Overall a job well done, looking forward to next year.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oMGhGXF_qCpM-eZSyfjOgw"}

She was friendly, kind and prepared. Her price was right and I immediately hired her.\n\nWe had an initial meeting in the beginning stages of my wedding planning and she came ready to ask all the right questions. As a first time bride, she made me feel at ease knowing what needed to be done and what to take care of. \n\nDuring the upcoming months before my wedding, she emailed me a packet to fill out that helped her prepare of a day of timeline. It included every question you could think of regarding contact info for vendors, who was walking with who down the aisle and what song to cut the cake to. \n\nWe had a second meeting a month before my wedding to go over the packet and all of the additional details for the day. We met at the reception venue and I was able to share with her and her assistant how I wanted things to look and where I wanted things to go, along with other information and fine details. That meeting was a great comfort to be and I knew my wedding was in good hands. \n\nIn the next few weeks leading up to my wedding Pauline and I shared numerous emails, text messages and phone calls. Paulina was always right there to help me, answer any questions and work with me on any changes or requests I had. She sent a mass email to all of my vendors the week of my wedding with my timeline information and handled confirming them all and any questions they had. I had one minor issue with my ceremony space and she was on the ball to take care of it and reassure me it was no big deal. We met again on rehearsal day and she went over everything with my family and friends about the ceremony and information for afterwards. She also took all of my decor to my reception space for me so I did not have to worry about it! \n\nAfter all the prep work leading up to the big day, my wedding day was absolutely perfect. If anything was an issue, I never saw or heard about it. Paulina and her assistant Katie were AMAZING! Paulina was there to set things up at the ceremony, helped decorate the space and put people where they needed to be. Katie helped set up the reception space at a different venue until Paulina arrived there and she also did a great job. Paulina helped calm my nerves, kept everything moving and made sure things all happened in a timely manner. After the ceremony, she went over to the reception where I met her and Katie when I arrived. Paulina was wonderful enough to help pin my dress for me and fix a minor stain on the back of my dress before I entered the reception space. That's right, my sweet and wonderful wedding coordinator helped me with my wedding dress! She even made sure that a server was there to give my husband and I some appetizers and drinks before our grand entrance! What a lifesaver as we were both starving and so thirsty! \n\nThe reception space was so gorgeous!! Everything I had imagined was made possible because of Paulina! The cake cutting, bouquet toss and everything in-between was well timed and perfect thanks to her. She even made sure I ate something and that my husband and I had a chance alone to take pictures in our photo-booth which we wouldn't have had otherwise!\n\nI will be forever grateful to Paulina for her amazing talents, skills and incredible work as my wedding coordinator! I will be recommending her to anyone I know who is planning to get married as she out did herself in every way possible by giving me the wedding of my dreams! My husband was also so thankful for her and made sure to let her know what a great job she did as well! We are both so appreciative of Paulina and I am so happy I hired her!!! You should too!

The only real \"craft\" selection they have is Ballast Point Sculpin, and, let's be honest, they just sold out for 1 billion dollars.  So come on, Pita Jungle.  Expand that craft beer selection.  I did love the wine on tap, including the wine that I enjoyed that gave all the profits to autism research.  Very cool.  The cilantro lime hummus is my favorite appetizer anywhere.  They had specially made olive oil and balsamic vinegar to eat with it as well that tasted amazing.  The bar service was fantastic.

Finally Freska is open, although I only knew it because of the previous review on Yelp since there is no mention of it on their Facebook page or official website.... and I had taken a few day break on my drive-by stalkings. \n\nMy husband and I both ordered the lamb/beef gyro plate and were pleased with the flavor of the meat and options for veggies, sauces, etc. to go on top.  The portion was very generous, especially for lunch! They have quite a few meat (and non-meat) options to either make a plate out of or assemble in a sandwich, making for a lot of combination options. The veggies all looked very fresh and presented in a way that made me want to order a big salad so I could taste them all.  In addition to our main plates, we tried the falafel side and tried to order the stuffed grape leaves, but they do not have these avaialble yet. I was quite disappointed about that since I love a good grape leaf, but the falafel made up for it.  The falafel side was a very decent portion, good texture, flavor and a great crisp on the outside.  I would have like a bit more of the sauce drizzled over the top.\n\nAs a last minute decision I picked up some baklava for dessert.  Overall, it was good, but I do think it could benefit from either a little more of the sugar syrup over the top layers or possibly the top section of phyllo not being as thick.  As is, it was difficult to cut through the top for a bite with my fork. The nut mixture and the bottom layers were delicious, so I ended up just removing the top section all together. \n\nAs expected the service is still getting ironed out.  I initially asked what was in the fresh veggie mix for the plates, thinking it would save time from requesting cucumber, tomato, and onion if it was all in the \"mix\".  Unfortunately, it was the guy's first day and he asked about 3 people before finally giving up.  By this point I had clogged up the line a bit -- completely unintentional.    There were also some inconsistencies in my plate being handed over the top to me versus being pushed down the line to the cashier so they would know what to ring up.  Small things, but during a busy lunch period it slowed everything down. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice, with plenty of seating at either booths or tables. Everything was very clean, bright, and inviting.  \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  It is very refreshing to have a locally owned, yet quick and healthy option for dining out in Middleton.  I love Mediterranean food, so will certainly be checking this place out again in the near future to sample other items on the menu.\n\nWhile they get their full website up and running, I did find a full menu from a place that did the design of it that you can peruse their offerings on:\nhttp://www.coroflot.com/msajdesign/Freska-Mediterranean-Grill-Menu", "type": "review", "business_id": "lT-xepsVXophxcxWERMsAw"}

I work near here, and if I don't bring a lunch, my food options are limited to burgers, fast food burgers, pub burgers...you get the picture.  So hearing that a Fresh-Prepared, Mediterranean style restaurant was going to be opening was music to my ears!  Needless to say...they've been open a little over a week, and I've been here three times (yes, I was that excited!).\n\nInside, the d\u00e9cor is very nice for a quick-eat place like this.  You can tell a lot of time and pride was put into this place.  Nice booths, tables, and the d\u00e9cor on the walls is unique and interesting.  I was surprised when my husband and I came with our toddler that they only had one high chair, and it was broken (no center strap, so we had to hold our kid in it with one hand while eating with the other or she'd slide right out).  To be broken when they'd only been open a week was strange, but we had bellies full of yummy food, so it wasn't even a big deal (although I'd suggest fixing this before someone who is a little more grumpy and anal about these things gets you in trouble for it!).\n\nLet me get to the food...omg...Salads! Platters! Sandwiches! Soups! It's so nice to have a plethora of vegetarian and vegan options.  So far, I've had the Falafel Plate, the Spinach Pie Platter, and the Greek Salad with Falafel. All were super fresh (the spinach pie was literally coming out of the oven), perfect sized portions. You have a very large selection of fresh and colorful veggies to add to your food, Brown Rice Pilaf or CousCous for your grain, and let's just have a moment of silence in appreciation of their perfectly browned and warmed pita bread...mmmmmm.\n\nThis place will definitely be leading me to \"forget\" my lunch at home more often so I can dine here frequently.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lT-xepsVXophxcxWERMsAw"}

But after my first bite of our slimy canned mushroom pizza, I expected to look up and see dart boards, pool tables, and a hammered \"regular\" named Sheila trying to pick up another married man. \nI don't think the pizza was as bad as Las Vegas Mini Grand Prix, as Gina wrote in her review, but not quite as good as Chucky Cheese either. \nAlso, it's a pizza place, maybe have hot peppers and parmesan cheese either already on the table, bring with pizza or at least ask the customer. \nIf this really is a pizza joint from back east (New York), Gina is right, the chain's reputation is being tarnished big time here. \nWell, with that being said, $45.00 later, I could have had a much better pizza staying home and making it myself. I'll never go back, highly NOT recommended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NtgJUuEB4eo1dIsDBO9Wbw"}

Adding on a single topping will run you a buck a slice. $14 for two pepperoni slices and a drink?! For a couple bucks more, you can get an entire 12\" specialty pie (tax + tip will make it ~$20). What Shark Tank reject did the valuation and menu pricing?!\n\nOpted for the featured Don Michele Meat Pizza (pepperoni, Italian sausage, smoked bacon, and onions), subbed mushrooms for the onions. Flavor was below average: they use canned mushrooms (which isn't in line with their premium prices), they forgot the bacon listed in the ingredients, and the pizza was under cooked in the middle.

It still sports the familiar blue awning over the front entrance, has the same impressive L-shaped bar and the iconic burger-centric menu.  There are differences if you look closely: the table tops are new, the new owners gave the joint a thorough cleaning and the service is significantly more attentive than it was during the Tony Franks death spiral.  This confluence of factors seems to be a winning combination - the place was near capacity when I visited for lunch on a Tuesday in mid-November.  \n\nI was promptly greeted as I entered and was instructed to find an open table.  A cheerful server arrived a minute later to take my drink order.  I let her know I needed to leave in 45 minutes, so I immediately ordered a corned beef Reuben sandwich with a half order of fries and silently wondered if the tiny kitchen could keep up with the sizable lunch crowd.  As I waited for the food, I watched the staff in action and they energetically engaged with the lunch time patrons, especially the bartender.  Despite the business, the noise level was not all that bad.\n\nMy order came in about five minutes and at first glance, passed the eye test.  My fries had a gorgeous golden brown hue and the marble rye was well toasted from its ample time on the griddle.  While the slices of bread used for my sandwich were not huge, the contents were generously portioned and poured out of the sandwich into the basket holding my meal.  While the fries went from freezer to the freezer to the fryer, they were well prepared, perfectly seasoned and delightfully crunchy.  Fortunately, the fries has enough flavor on their own because the \"House Recipe\" brand ketchup was way too sweet for my tastes- blech. Since none of the sandwiches on the menu come with a side, ordering a half order of fries for $1.99 is a solid option.  \n\nMy Reuben ($7.95) was standard bar and grill fare with institutional grade ingredients.  While the griddle work with the bread was solid, the generic corned beef needed more sear to add additional flavor, since the meat was on the bland side.  The flavor that predominated my meal was the overpowering kraut that was copiously applied.  The kitchen followed the standard script for assembling a Reuben without applying any unique touch - there was nothing memorable about this sandwich. While I didn't order one, I do have to add that the burgers served at the neighboring tables looked outstanding.\n\nWhile I'm glad this location has successfully re-opened, the standard pub fare means I probably won't become a regular.

After a Saturday at the mall of shopping with my daughter we were famished. My fellow Yelp buddy Rochelle H. told me about The Fire Side Public House just opening the day before and that they were doing a \"soft opening\" and that all of the food was comped as long as you bought a drink (pop, beer etc.) so my daughter and I high tailed it over there to meet up with Rochelle and her daughter and check the place out! \n\nUpon entering we were greeted and asked to be seated right next to Rochelle and her daughter. Surprisingly the place wasn't packed at all. A few seconds later Dane C. our waiter came over and took our drink orders. The concept of the restaurant is all about the wood fire grill that sits in the middle of the restaurant that everything is cooked on. They also specialize in craft beer. The menu consists of Small Bits, Wings, Wood Grill Items, Salads and Skillet served items for now will more items to be added once the restaurant is running at full capacity.\n \nMy daughter started off with the Beer Cheese & Bacon Fires (Fresh cut fries, Apple Wood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Beer Cheese) off the Small plates menu and I went with the Smoked Chicken Nachos. (Apple Wood Smoked Chicken, tortilla chips, grilled corn, black beans, sour cream, salsa verde and avocado.) I also added a order of grilled Garlic Parmesan wings. A few minutes later our small plates came. Let me tell you that there is nothing small about the Smoked Chicken Nachos portions! It could easily feed two to three people! I only ate about half. My daughter loved her Beer Cheese Fries as well.\n\nFor our main dishes my daughter choose the Fire Side Burger (Grass Fed Beef, Apple Wood Bacon, pickles, White Cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onions on a Brioche Bun). I choose the Chicken Skillet Pasta (Chicken Sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, Basil infused cream, Pappardelle and Fontina Cheese). It was absolutely delicious! I took a bite of my daughters burger and let me just say that I was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted! I finally got my wings after my main food already came. It was the place's second night being open so I will cut them some slack. \n\nAfter we were done with our meals we had to try the desserts. My daughter ordered the Campfire S 'Mores (Fire Roasted Marshmallows, milk chocolate, and Honey Grahams cereal). I picked the Blueberry Cobbler. The blueberry cobbler was simply spectacular! My daughter must of loved her S 'Mores as she finished it before I could even taste it! \n\nDane C. took excellent care of was the entire evening and never let our glasses get more than a quarter empty before he brought us another Pepsi. My only complaint it that the wings need to come out a lot faster then there are now. I'm sure once the kinks get worked out that this will be rectified.\n\nI also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Robert Miller who also owns Sidelines Bar & Grille. He was very appreciative for my critiques,  ideas and feedback.\n\nI think the restaurants concept will be welcomed with open arms by the East Liberty community.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hx0hjSz9G_YtXJ1GmK6DvA"}

The problem that I had with the restaurant is that the menu was very limited and to make a long drive for hot dog and fresh cut fries, although tasty, just wasn't worth it.  Additionally, paying $15 or so for said hot dog and fries just wasn't worth the effort.  Hey, I can go get a pack of high quality hot dogs and a couple of potatoes and feed a horde for the same price.  Would I have the same accoutrements?  Not necessarily, but close enough!\n\nThat leads me to the re-opening of the same space as The Fire Side Public House.  Now, my cousin told me that the new owners were having a \"soft opening\" and that I should get there quickly.  (I have been eyeballing the opening of this place for quite some time, so I hightailed it over there and I called my fellow Yelper Tim W. to let him in on the soft opening secret.)\n\nThe ambiance of the place is literally \"smoky hipster-chic\".  (They have a show kitchen centered around a Grillworks oven.   The owners also own Sidelines Beer House in Sewickley, which opened in 2012, and Sidelines Bar & Grille in Millvale, ) The menu includes sandwiches, burgers, small plates and entrees.  I have actually been to the restaurant/pub on two different occasions and they're barely open, so be a little patient with them.  On my first occasion, I had the grilled Siracha Maple Bacon wings and my daughter Muff had the Smoked Chicken Nachos as appetizers.  The wings were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that they actually came AFTER my entr\u00e9e.  (That's a timing issue that the chefs have to work out.)  My daughter enjoyed her nachos and I thought that they were good, but I think that they can be GREAT if they truly \"smoke\" the chicken ahead of time and then heat it/sear it right before serving.\n\nNow to the entrees!  I had the Blue Corn Shrimp & Grits and my daughter had the Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken.  I am a shrimp & grit connoisseur!  The Fire Side's shrimp & grit dish was tasty.  Wood-fired Cajun seasoned shrimp over blue corn grits with an over easy egg?  Shoooot!  Sign me up!  Minor complaint?  Yes!  I love almost any type of shrimp in any form or fashion, but peeling grilled head-on shrimp after they have been \"stuck\" in grits is not a pleasant experience.  Lose the shrimp \"body\" shell, keep the head on and grill away! (They have another shrimp dish that is prepared similarly, \"Smoked Prawns\",that is better served by this style of preparation because the diner is not asked to dip their hands into grits to enjoy the shrimp.)  Muff's Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken needed a dose of additional seasoning/sauce to enhance the dish.\nThe desserts that we had, Campfire S'Mores and Blueberry Cobbler served in cast iron pans were delicious.  The S'Mores dish needed a little more graham crackers and the chocolate needs to be placed on top of the crackers and not at the bottom of the pan. (Burned the chocolate in spots.)  Blueberry Cobbler?  Yummy!  They should change the cobbler seasonally.\n\nOn my second occasion, we had their signature Fire Side burger, Smoked Prawns, Beer Cheese & Bacon Fries and Chicken Skillet Pasta.  All of these dishes were decent and the service on both occasions was excellent.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.\n\nWas everything excellent?  No, but they are definitely heading in the right direction.  Once they tweak and refine a couple of the dishes, (E.g., The beer cheese sauce was way too thin) they will definitely be worthy of 5 stars, in my humble opinion.  They have all of the makings (I.e., Reasonable price points, tasty menu offerings, great service) of a five star pub, just give them a moment to get their bearings.  We need this type of place in the East End where you can leisurely enjoy tasty food and drinks without competing in expensive parking Olympics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hx0hjSz9G_YtXJ1GmK6DvA"}

Not really a place for a cocktail menu laden with high end ingredients,  but a nice menu worth a look and definitely something for everyone.  The draft beer selection has a lot of local and PA brews with some good seasonals.  They have a nice late night happy hour- $4 for any 16 oz beer below 7% abv.  The beer bottles seem overpriced, with a grapefruit sculpin coming in at 8.50. This is a good place for beers after 9 pm. \n\nThe service was odd. Beers and food came out strangely timed.. Almost one item at a time so one person sat with no drink or entree.  \n\nThe food was alright. Some kitchen mixups resulted in one app being doubled and the other showing up very late.

The Fire Side Public House, a tucked away spot behind the East Liberty Target which opened a few weeks ago, and a spot I could not wait to get my hands on it.\n\nMy friend J and I went on Monday evening before he takes off to South America for the holidays. Even before you enter the location, you get a bright invitation illuminating from its door, being covered in blue/white holiday lights around the roof and windows. I'm not sure if this is seasonally intended or just for sake of brightness, but either way I was happy to see it lit up.\n\nInside, your eye is immediately guided to the center of the restaurant, taken up by the large vent with Fire Side Public House proudly displaying over the wood fire island cooking station. From side view, along the length of the restaurant it's set up as follows: Left [front] is the large board of beers and cocktails, middle [under the vent] are the open prep, cooking/grilling and plating stations where you get a grand view of your food being charred and assembled, while you take in the intoxicating smells of the burgers and the skillets. On the right [back] there are a few tables for parties larger than two. The entire cooking island is ringed by bar space, always my favorite place to sit. Above you, there is breathtaking art of our favorite Steel City from various angles and in various sizes. It's easy to miss until you follow up the vent and see where it leads. I much like that they are able to use the otherwise neglected ceiling and altogether it leaves you with a comforting feeling of sitting around a big fireplace.\n\nThe beer list is sizable for this small space with local, regional and national microbrews on tap and in the bottle. On the other side of the drink menu you get a whole listing of seasonal specialty cocktails. Naturally right now they are holiday styled. I was really tempted to get the \"Santa, I know him!\" just for the name but I was trying to constrain myself as it was Monday. The menu is sleek and simple, but considering that I had prime view of everything that was being served, my mouth watered at everything. J and I had a skillet each, mine the Chicken Pasta, his the Blue corn shrimp and grits. Each looked great. The chicken sausage was hearty and the pasta done just right. Two mentions: The consistency was a little bit off for me, the basil infused cream was a bit on the milky side, having the effect of \"washing\" the pasta, rather than coating it as a sauce should. Also, it came off too delicate. The basil flavoring a bit lost and it definitely needed salt. I'm sure they skimped on the salt in favor of the basil and the sausage, but as none of the ingredients bonded together [not even with the help of the grated fontina cheese], I was definitely missing a bite. \n\nThe blue corn shrimp on the other hand looked awesome, and I was experiencing food-envy. It was served with three massive prawns and the grits were served good and hearty. I will be checking that out for next time. I hear it was good, despite him attempting to ruin it by drenching his food in hot sauce. [Sigh, that man cannot eat any food without hot sauce]\n\nLastly, it is very well priced for the quality and portion of food that you get. I'm happy to have walked away with a full but not overloaded feeling as even a carby pasta dish came off light even with a beverage you should be under the $20 dollar mark which is refreshing for the location and the fact that pittsburgh's more recent places are getting out of hand. [see other reviews]\n\nAll in all I am very pleased with my experience at FSPH, especially as it's close to my new home. I will definitely be coming back to try everything else on this menu and hopefully still before the the \"Santa, I know him!\" disappears from the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hx0hjSz9G_YtXJ1GmK6DvA"}

Overall, the staff was very polite and personable. They checked on us often. I'm not exactly sure who the server was because two people seemed to be taking care of us at different times. While confusing, it was a great to see the staff working as a team because we were well taken care of so and never had to wait for the server.\nThe restaurant is beautiful and I really Liked the open layout of the restaurant and the dark wood tables. The open kitchen takes up about half of the space. The women's restroom was very clean, however it reminded me of a fast food bathroom with the red tile floor.\nNow onto the food and drinks. The cocktails were appropriately titled from Elf the movie (e.g., \"Santa, I know him!\"). They came quickly and were delicious. We ordered two appetizers: the crab hush puppies and the shrimp stuffed avocados. You MUST try the hush puppies!! The sauce was delightful, although we wished for more spice. The puppies themselves were flavorful, crisp on the outside and cooked to perfection. The avocado, on the other hand, was not stuffed. The shrimp and salsa was situated next to a grilled half avocado, which was a bit unripe. The shrimp and salsa did not have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this.\nEntree wise we ordered the asparagus baguette and the shrimp and grits. I Loved the baguette! There was a wonderful jam on the sandwich that really complimented the feta and grilled asparagus. It came with crispy fries on the side. The shrimp and grits were flavorful, but not what we were expecting. The grits tasted like over seasoned warm cornbread batter and the shrimp were tough and overcooked. \nFor dessert, we had both the blueberry cobbler and the s'mores. They were served beautifully in tiny cast iron skillets. The cobbler was topped off with fresh vanilla ice cream. Although it didn't have a crumbly crust, it had fragrant lemon undertones that packed a punch! It was lovely. The s'mores was not so great. The first layer was melted chocolate, the second layer was a graham cereal topped with huge toasted marshmallows. It was hard to eat because the marshmallows were not melted and the cereal seemed stale in the melted chocolate. It sounded great, but it just didn't work.\nOverall, everything was a hit or miss.

Not the decision to stop at the Hong Kong Cafe for lunch!\n\nFor those of you familiar with dining at the Palazzo and Venetian, this is merely a rebranded Zine restaurant.  The interior is a bit different but the menu is mostly the same, with some Hong Kong items added.  I was all about that Vietnamese Satay soup; they don't do it with oxtail anymore, only with Filet.  Whatever, it's super good.  We were also excited about getting some Fried Fish Balls with Curry.  Were is the important term here.\n\nService was hideously bad! Sat there for a good 15 minutes before our server deigned to come over to ask if we'd like something to drink.  It took another good 15 minutes before he came back to see if we wanted to order food.  Here's the worst part: they weren't that busy and I saw our same server go to three different tables that were not full of white people.  I hate calling this kind of stuff out, but, no lie, he went to a table near us 5 times in the interim between me asking for water and me being able to order food. We had 4 white people; they were 4 Asian people.  Perhaps they were also 'important' or 'high rollers' or whatever; at the end of the day, our money is the same and you, sir, are a shitty waiter.\n\nWe finally ordered our food and our waiter, when he comes back to confirm our order, asks if I ordered the Edamame. I say no, no edamame. Fried Fish Balls with Curry.  He says, \"The curry sauce is spicy.\"  In my mind: \"I doubt it...\"  Out loud: \"Yes, I know.  I like it spicy.  Extra if you can.\"  He says, ok and leaves.  It's a good 15+ minutes until I can flag someone else down to refill our water and try to order a beer.  It's Vegas! It's been close to an hour and I have no food and no drinks. WTF?!?!\n\nFood finally comes on the trolley cart and our nice, but totally clueless food runner does not have the Fish Balls, the Kim Chee, or any bowls and spoons for my soup.  We explain this to her.  She comes back a few minutes later with bowls; that is all.  While waiting, we try some of the soup with the chopsticks (we would use them the whole time, but Jim G's mom and friend are with us; they need spoons). The soup is super cold; the noodles are a congealed mess underneath the film that has developed on the top.  The clueless food runner brings the Fish Balls. They are cold and flavorless.  We have totally had enough.\n\nJim G. goes to find a manager and it even took a good 5+ minutes for her to come by! Michelle, the manager, had the perfect attitude from the beginning.  She was apologetic and wanted to replace everything we had.  Unfortunately, we were at the point where we didn't want to patronize their establishment in any way.  She gladly offered to pay for the two beers we had, plus the food we ordered.  She didn't feel the need to offer to pay for our dining companions' food.  Now, they claimed that their food was fine; but, considering the way the afternoon unfolded, everyone was uncomfortable, and, even with food that is 'fine,' no one dined well.  It would've been an even more generous gesture to pick up the whole bill.  And, our clueless waiter continued to check on the nearby table of non-white people. When he came back to us, he had the gall to ask if we needed something else! We hadn't seen him in more than 40 minutes and the manager had already been by a few times. \n\nJim G. and I walked out having had a beer and a few bites of Kim Chee.  With all the options at The Palazzo/Venetian complex, you can be sure that we will never waste any of our time at this dining establishment.  When the food is made well and the servers deign to pay you any attention, you might have a nice time here.  If not, then why pay top dollar to be treated like shit?  No thanks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83oSCi5H1PE9A82jwINBDQ"}

I was in dire need of some hot Asian soup and they have a lot to choose from.  I had the filet with the spicy sauce to help unjam my sinus that were blocked the whole trip.  The soup did the trick.  It's a huge portion, so I go through most of it.  If I wasn't sick, I no doubt could polish it off.  My partner had the Kung Pao Chicken - it was $24 for a medium size plate and $3 extra for rice - pretty pricey considering the HUGE soups ranged from $16-18 and worth it for the size.  Drinks are $12 a crack for the fancy things.  I had the hot tea - also good.  We tried the chicken wings for an appetizer...needed some sauce in my opinion, but decent.  The service - trying really hard, but still getting their sea legs.  Brought my partner's meal and mine showed up maybe 5 minutes later...not a good thing.  I'd go back though for soup only.  This was a $100 dinner for two people and you can see from what we ordered it can get pricey if you go off the soup menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83oSCi5H1PE9A82jwINBDQ"}

Yes, the menu is practically the same but they also added some new Hong Kong caf\u00e9 inspired items.

Shame on you if you knew they just opened less than a week ago and you still rate them harshly. The environment, procedures are still new to the waiters, waitresses, bus boys, hostess, kitchen crew...etc. They're still trying to get the hang of things. I'm sure you weren't \"perfect\" the first few weeks...heck, even the first month coming into your new job. Cut them some slack. If service still \"suck\" months later...then I would understand your concern.\n\nWe came for dinner on a Monday night. We ordered an appetizer sampler to share. It comes with dumplings, shui mai, egg rolls and shrimp tempura. (2 pieces each). For my entr\u00e9e, I got pho and my boyfriend got a small cup of wonton soup and Singapore style vermicelli. Food was delicious and authentic. Only gripe I had was our food didn't come out very hot. The vermicelli was lukewarm. We simply asked our waiter to make it hotter. He came back within 3 minutes and it was pippin hot....steam coming out of the noodles and all. \n\nThe prices are on the higher side...but what can we expect? They ARE located on the strip in a high-end hotel after all. On the strip=strip prices. No surprises there. If you really can't bite the bullet and pay $16.95 for a big bowl of pho....then I suggest you drive down to Chinatown.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83oSCi5H1PE9A82jwINBDQ"}

I would recommend any or all of these items.\n\nThe service was all pretty good. I saw some other commenters saying that they felt Chinese customers were getting treated better than white customers, but I'm white and didn't feel any different in the way I was treated. Maybe not all of the staff has great English, but the hostesses and servers all seemed pretty fluent, if not native speakers. Either way, they all seemed like they were doing their best to provide good service regardless of who the customer was.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good dining experience. It was a little bit on the pricey side for what you get, so I don't feel justified giving it five stars, but that's most likely because it's on the Strip, so I'm not going to rate them too low, either.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83oSCi5H1PE9A82jwINBDQ"}

The crispy noodle was something that I had never had and I thought it was interesting.  I would probably order the pan fried noodles or chow mein next time.  The fried rice was on point.  Good flavor and lots of meat.\nValue:  Because it is located in Palazzo, this place is terribly over priced.  Almost $20 for fried rice is a terrible rip off.

The Bertha, with lemon shrub, gin, and muddled cucumber and mint, was delicious.\n\nThe food menu features creative takes on familiar recipes and ingredients, with much-appreciated vegetarian and gluten-free options. The Brussels sprout appetizer was amazing. Seriously, just order it. I also had the Vegetable Pot, an updated veggie pot pie, which was perfect comfort food that still felt healthy. The thin, crispy crust was poured over the top and well seasoned with herbs and cheese. Because there was no pie crust on the bottom or sides, it wasn't too heavy. The filling was a blend of potatoes,  carrots and peas in a creamy vegetarian gravy. \n\nThe renovation is gorgeous, with lots of exposed wood, windows and open space. The atmosphere preserves the comfort of Billy's, but with a vibe you'd expect more from Lawrenceville than Troy Hill. Live terrariums on every table, well-spaced seating, and fun touches like board games, an area with couches, a jukebox, and pinball make it feel inviting. All of the staff were super friendly, too, and checked in to chat and ask for feedback. \n\nI'm so glad to see this place in Troy Hill.

All of the entrees were enjoyed as well, but the Stroganoff was my favorite...served with super creamy grits, mushrooms, horseradish sauce and amazingly tender chunks of beef cheek. \n\nIt's great to see a place like this up on Troy Hill and I hope they stick around!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YOvCez-P5HPTJ407l1JC2Q"}

Another of our group booked a couple of days beforehand so it was no surprise when we walked through the door. After reading the reviews here, I'm sorry to have to say that this is a place I would never ever recommend to someone I care about.\n\nThe service was very, very slow, it took nearly an hour for our orders to be taken and then they were taken twice more over the next hour and a half. The food arrived slowly, in dribs and drabs, and five of us hadn't been served at all when I finally left, two and a half hours after the time of our booking. \n\nDuring that time, the server became increasingly short and distracted, when asked if someone could have plain fries rather than \"pig fries\" with bacon on the second time of taking orders she just snapped \"no\". She also ignored repeated polite requests for glasses of water until finally she brought two, even though there were eight people at our table, and disappeared. The water had to be brought by someone else, the front of house person, after we had been there for about an hour and a half. Then we had plenty of water... but still no food for half of us.\n\nAt no time did our party get loud, rude or disruptive to other diners, being nice, well-brought up professional people, but we were obviously unhappy and the front of house person, who I later was told is one of the owners, came and chatted with us in a friendly way. However, he seemed to have no control over the kitchen, especially not the \"chef\". When asked about the fries, he went away and came back saying the reason why I (yes, it was me) couldn't have plain fries was that they only have one fryer so the fries are cooked in the same fryer as the meat. Two people at our table had ordered the veggie burger, which came with - you've guessed it - \"plain\" fries, the very same cooked-in-the-meat-fryer-fries as the Pig fries on the menu, just without the bacon bits. I'm not a rampant radical about not eating meat, I just don't choose to do so myself - I ordered the catfish - but to list a vegetarian option on the menu and for it not to be vegetarian is a serious betrayal of the trust of your patrons.\n\nWhen I finally cancelled my dinner order and left after two and a half hours enjoying the company and nursing one glass of beer and one glass of water, I asked for my bill and was told it was on the house. The rest of our group was still there, and I don't think the meals ever came for some of them, although lots of free drinks were offered.\n\nI later learned that nothing was charged for all the drinks and the meals that did get served, but I'll say this: reparations are never as effective for your reputation as doing something the right way to start with. I will never go there again even though it is close to the house of a friend, and will tell any of my friends who is thinking of eating there what our experience was. \n\nThis is not a review written in hasty reaction to the experience. I hope the owners/partners of Scratch clean up their act soon, Troy Hill deserves an interesting place to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YOvCez-P5HPTJ407l1JC2Q"}

My husband devoured the halusky before I could get a taste but the Reuben was divine. There was a smokiness to the beef tongue (which was not at all tough like I imagined), and a sweetness and tanginess to the beet kraut.

I have been hoping downtown chandler would start to bring in some new, hip places into the area and this seems like a great step forward for the city. My husband had a whiskey ginger and Bullet was this well whiskey at the time which is pretty impressive. He said it was made just right.

Another thing I don't like is the lack of food.  You don't have to have a full menu but a few snack items and things to munch on go a long way. Also the music choice is sub par and not because of the music but because it's XM (which I love in my car) but I don't want to hear their \"Sirius XM\" add every 5 minutes.  \n\nOther than that,  the beer selection is great.  They have a few wines for the ladies which is a nice touch.

You can make it greasy, like 5G does, but you can't make it juicy. You have a grill. Figure out how to cook a burger to order and slap a warning on the menu. \n\n- A little expensive. $10.50 for a burger with avocado and a small fries isn't terrible, but it's nothing to rave about. I can get a better burger cooked to order at Roast Public House for that. \n\n- No nutrition calculator. Am I really supposed to page through a Byzantine table to add up each ingredient? Make a damn calculator. \n\n-According to their website, a single burger is 5.3 ounces pre-cooked. A double burger is two 3.3 ounce patties.

We sat outside and reviewed the menu and neither of us were really thrilled but decided we could swing it.  I was pointing out some of the newer places when I saw The Smashed Pig and said \"When did that open?\"  Since no one had acknowledged us at Park yet we got up and crossed the street to check out the menu.  The front bar guy sold us on the two person beef hanger steak butcher block and told us they had opened two days ago. So we came on in to give it a try.  That was an excellent choice.\n\nWe started out with the lamb tacos which had nicely spiced and tender lamb in a crispy fried eggplant shell topped with sweet pepper chutney.  Then our main arrived and it was glorious.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was superb. The Sakai sauce that came with it was a perfect accompaniment to that and the greens.  The mashed potatoes had to have had at least a stick of butter in them; that was a very good thing.  And the simple field green salad that accompanied it had a ginger dressing my brother loved.  It was quite simply one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.  We also had the sticky toffee pudding which was good, but couldn't live up the main course.\n\nI also ordered their Tow Rag cocktail which was quite refreshing and not very sweet at all.  My brother tried the Tenya Creek Hefeweizen which was so good we both got another.  Brandon was our server and he was informative and attentive.  Martin, the owner, even stopped by the table to make sure everything was fine.  I will most definitely be stopping back in to give lunch a try one Friday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ubs9MQn65_dpzpHG1HaRwQ"}

What I really really want. I want fish and chips with a zigazig-ha! What exactly is a zigazig-ha? I hope it's food-related and not something offensive.\n\nWe sat next to the kitchen which was cool so, we can watch the magic in the kitchen...we ended up smelling like oil and food after dinner but it's alright. Their dinner menu is small. A few appetizers, burgers, garlic fries, mashed potatoes, fish and chips, trifle, sticky toffee pudding, butcher's block for 2, and a few other items. Their drink menu is much longer. They feature special items for lunch.\n\nYorkshire Pudding:\nWarm balls of light and airy bread drizzled with sticky sweetness. The gravy you dip them in is wonderful. 5/5\n\nCrispy Deviled Eggs:\nI've been having deviled egg cravings a lot lately and I'm not even a fan of egg yolks. This version has the usual paprika but with crispy bits and cornichons. Creamy egg yolk, soft egg white and crispy bread crumbs. 4/5\n\nFish and Chips:\nTwo decently-sized fish that have been lightly breaded and fried until golden. The chips that they came with were crispy and flavorful. I asked our server to substitute my chips with garlic fries but I think she forgot - I'm glad she did though because it might've been too much goodness for me to handle.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding:\nWarm pudding with toffee sauce and cream on top. The portion is not ginormously humungo - it's good for two people. It's sweet but what sticky toffee pudding isn't?\n\nThe service was very friendly. From the server, bartender, and the chef. They were playing songs by Brits: The Beatles, Everything But the Girl,  Adele, Rollin Stones...I didn't stick around long enough for Spice Girls.

Or at least that's my story after another phone battery outage during a restaurant visit...\n\n(Sorry about that. I did get some photos courtesy of a friend who finally made time for lunch during a return visit to Vegas, I was originally going to introduce him to a certain new sushi burrito place but our mutual local buddy said that we should try this new place downtown called The Smashed Pig. I can be a bit of a sucker for brand-new places these days, so I agreed.)\n\n(Oh, and that sushi note? Interestingly, Nobu Matsuhisa-trained chefs Linda Rodriguez and Martin Swift formerly ran a Red Rock Resort restaurant called Hachi, no relation to the new Hachi on Jones near Spring Mountain. That explains some of the Japanese influence in a simple one-page food menu otherwise easily mistaken for that of a British pub.)\n\nThis self-proclaimed gastropub opened a couple weeks ago in a former tattoo parlor, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Las Vegas Blvd. Interestingly, they're only open 2-11pm on the weekends right now. As I recall, the bartender/server mentioned that morning traffic has been slow on the weekends in this cold season. That all said, we were fortunate to arrive after opening, and we seated ourselves at the bar after being told that the restaurant section would be unavailable until the server's scheduled start time at around 4.\n\nI could go on and on about the comfortable atmosphere and the bartender's menu knowledge and friendliness, but let's get to the food already.\n\nFrench Bean Tempura ($7): wholly ordered off the bartender's recommendation. She called it \"crack,\" and I can't disagree. It's pretty straightforward tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers, but I could hardly stop eating it. I'd get it next time in a heartbeat.\n\nLamb \"Tacos\" ($9): not the most beautiful colors ever seen in a dish, but a nice spice profile somewhere in the vicinity of the Middle East or India, some serviceable sour cream, an sweet pepper chutney that's addictive on its own, and a crispy eggplant that substitutes for a hard shell. Overall, another fantastic appetizer. I considered ordering a second helping, but I wanted to try other items instead.\n\nCrispy Deviled Eggs ($8): served with cornichons (tart, mildly sweet pickle) and dusted w/ paprika. Lacked the oomph of the other two appetizers, especially in the hard boiled white. It's good, but not exceptional.\n\n(I skipped the $3-a-piece oysters based on the bartender's description of their small/medium size,  verified by my observation, and they weren't particularly impressive per my friend.)\n\nThe Smashed Pig Burger ($14): seems like all beef to me, ironically. Ordered medium and without cheddar (+$1) per my visiting friend. It's served with sea salt garlic fries, which may be a tad underseasoned and not so potent in garlic but are otherwise perfectly textured (you know, the whole crispy/fluffy thing) and go well with either ketchup or the burger sauce (a mixture of ketchup, mayo, sriracha, and a sauce whose name escaped the 'tender but may be the \"HP\" brown sauce). This sauce really helps out the burger too, which is not great until the sauce is added.\n\nFish and Chips ($16): two large cod fillets with tartar, hot mushy peas (not joking, almost burned my fingers), and malt vinegar. I have had much less experience with fish and chips than I'd like, but even if this dish isn't done the proper way, it's done the right way. You can't go wrong with really moist fish inside a crispy batter, and all the condiments work, including the very palatable peas. Oh, and the same fries from earlier serve as the chips here. Maybe a little pricey, but I was happy enough even if my wallet wasn't.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding ($5): this was somehow at least as wonderful as the toffee pudding that I recently tried at the now-closed David Clawson Restaurant. This moist, delicious cake topped with whipped cream and a caramel sauce that's less viscous that anticipated is, dare I suggest it, destination-worthy. It was certainly a worthy end to a marvelous meal\n\nWhile the gastropub experience might be considered incomplete without particular beverages, I abstained from alcohol due to DD duties. I will note that my friends seemed to enjoy the canned craft beers, such as the Back Home gingerbread stout. Maybe I'll try it next time, or I could pick a beer pairing specific to each menu item.\n\nWith a disclaimer that I haven't visited nearly all of the other Downtown Las Vegas restaurants, I currently can't recommend another nearby restaurant over The Smashed Pig. I'd say that Carson Kitchen (NOTE: based on an old visit) isn't as good, and Park on Fremont across the street should just shut down now and save themselves the agonizing death. Whether you want a full meal or a quick bite, you should definitely stop here the next time you're in DTLV. Better yet, make this the focal point of your visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ubs9MQn65_dpzpHG1HaRwQ"}

This pub on fremont street is an upscale version of a traditional pub.

I was originally planning to order the bangers and mash, but it's a dinner item so I chose the linguine special. It was $10 and cane with a side salad. My friend ordered the shrimp sliders, and we got the crispy deviled eggs as a starter. The staff was very friendly, no snobbery going on here! The food was fantastic! Fan-fkn-tastic even. My pasta was so perfectly cooked, I'm pretty sure they made the pasta in-house. It was delicate yet sturdy, with the bacon adding a sweet smoky flavor while the French beans provided a tart crunch. It was perfectly executed. The crispy deviled eggs surprised me because I was assuming they would've had sausage on them like a scotch egg. There was no sausage but I'm not complaining. The bottom portion of the egg (white part) was breaded and fried, yet there was no trace of greasy residue, just a tasty crispy crust.

I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.\n\nFRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.\nTODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.\nLAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.\nCRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.\n\nI was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits?

I'll start this review with a disclaimer. I KNOW this was a soft opening event and there are bugs (major) to work out. All food and beverages were comped and appropriate tips were left for the servers. Now to the review.... When invited to this invitation only event, I was offered 3 \"seating times\" for me and my 3 guests, 5:30, 6:30, and 7:30. We chose 7:30, assuming we would stay late and play games. No closing times were indicated in any of the promotional materials sent for the event. Upon arrival, the check in process was very quick and well organized. As soon as we went in (7:15) we requested a table for 6 (we met 2 other friends there) and were put on the waiting list. 2 of us sat at the bar while the others went off to play games. The bartenders were excellent, very attentive and were either experienced or very well trained. Kudos to them. It took 45 minutes to be called for our table. Understandable for a busy night. Here's where it fell apart. We placed our order for an appetizer.  and a round of drinks (we all received 2 free drink coupons. When our waitress brought our drinks, we placed our meal orders. 30 minutes later (8:30) there was an announcement that the VIP event would be ending in 30 minutes! Still no dinner.... The waitress apologized for dinner taking so long. Some of us then asked her for our 2nd drink, as they were waiting to use the 2nd drink coupon with dinner. \"Sorry, that announcement was Last Call so the bar is now closed.\" The manager then came over to apologize for the delay in our food and told us we could stay past 9:00 and enjoy our meal. I asked him if we could get our last round of drinks (just draft beer). He also said no, because the bar was closed, but we were brought waters. 15 minutes later, our dinner came, and so did our appetizer. We did ask our waitress earlier to check on our appetizer. I guess either she forgot or it still wasn't ready. A good thing we had the appetizer because they brought the wrong dinner for one of our guests, so he ate some of the boneless wings while waiting for the right dinner. It took another 15-20 minutes for his dinner to come out, as the rest of us had started our dessert. They brought his dinner out in a to-go box instead of on a plate, so he opened his to-go box and ate his dinner. We saved him a few bites of dessert. We were the 2nd to last group to leave. All the employees were lined up at the door clapping for everyone as they left. I actually had the feeling at that point they were clapping because they were happy to see us leave!\n\nWill I be back? Doubt it. I'm at Westgate for every home Coyotes game. Their Happy Hour prices are not competitive with places in Westgate such as Buffalo Wild Wings. The manager's poor accommodations left a bad taste in my mouth. If he would have, at least, offered us a free beer on a return visit (since we couldn't use our last drink coupon), I might have been more likely to try the place again before a Coyotes game.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CC8-73NAWvXKE1ArCkdMfg"}

Despite a few hiccups with  double booking the room and setting up our party in the Billiards area, we had a great time!  The manager, Mark was fantastic.  He literally pushed up his sleeves and got to work to help us get things arranged and set up.\n\nThe food was delicious.  Many of my customers were pleasantly surprised!  We had vegetable lasagna and rosemary chicken with veggies and two salads.  Sometimes food on a buffet line can be dry, but ours was very moist and delicious.  The salted caramel brownies were decadent but not too sweet!\n\nDespite being a VERY BUSY NIGHT with many Christmas Parties, a UFC event and a hockey game next door I found all of the employees very friendly, helpful and very organized!  There was even a young lady (never caught her name) at the front door informing all guests that they were at capacity and giving them the wait times.  Very up front if you ask me so that guests didn't go into the establishment to find this out.\n\nThe servers that took care of my group, Amanda and McKenna were absolutely wonderful!  Amanda especially took charge of our area and informed us every step of the way when food was coming, helped us clear off the pool tables for games and helped with a few of our customers special dietary needs.\n\nMy advice, check the local activities at Westgate to see how busy it may be before you choose a day to go visit.  The selection of games was great!  Many neat items to pick from when redeeming your tickets!  Parking is a little tricky on event nights.  We will be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CC8-73NAWvXKE1ArCkdMfg"}

The inside is well decor'd however what made it a 1 star rating is the service. My friends and I walked from the bar to the dining area where my other co-workers were and we accidentally walked in their station. We apologized and the female employee says, 'well don't do it again!' Wow, we knew after walking through it was their station. Human mistake and very rude. Next the waiter for our dining experience was great in the beginning but something seemed very odd. Our boss was with us and he was great when he was around; brown nosing him, saying 'whatever you want boss', 'you got it boss'. Until he left (our boss) is when he got bad..Two of us ordered drinks that paid cash, the rest paid with card. We both required change. My tab was $4.13 and I gave him $10.00. I think he was under the impression the change was his tip! When I asked my friend if she got her change after he brought back the others their cards back, she said no. I haven't also. I asked him where's  my change? He looked at me puzzled and says oh you got that drink? He say's what? I told him I gave you a $10 and my drink was $4.13, so where's my change? He thought for a second and say's oh don't worry I got you and proceeds to take out $5.00 from his pocket and tells my co-worker who ordered a Coors light that cost $3.99 that she has no change only 10 cents! So what! It's still money! And than he changes his story and says her beer was not $3.99 it's $4.99 so there's no change. She say's what so I owe you? How can that be, I bought beer at the bar for $3.99. He says oh, no your beer is not $3.99 it's $4.90 and the price is different at the bar than from the dinning. WTH?! Is this guy for real? She let it go because it was pennies to her. Oh not me! He forgot to bring 2 more silverware that we asked for earlier, he kept forgetting to bring the others drinks and when I asked, where's my 87 cents, AGAIN he looked puzzled. He says, oh I don't carry change??So...do the right thing! I want my receipt I said and he finally came back with is apologizing but it's too late now. It may be only 87 cents but that adds up and I bet he's sorry now for the terrible service because he would've got something but instead got nothing. I want to bring my family back I just don't know if we will dine because of the negative experience.

When you're in a profession that customarily rewards service with tips that reflect the level of quality, it's amazing that customer service is a problem. Many people are willing to pay for good service. A large part of the blame belongs to management. Lack of training, engagement and awareness of what's happening in their establishment is reflected on the staffs low-level performance.

I liked their peanut dipping sauce a lot. The only thing is that I would def share that appetizer, because eating 2 of those big rolls on your own is too much and at the end the shrimp started tasting weird to me.  Also I didn't care too much for the pickled carrots inside, I think I would have preferred just regular carrots!\n\nFor my meal I got the Spicy Noodle Soup that came with tofu, fake \"beef\", potatoes, bean sprouts, and noodles.  I loved the flavor of this soup, very spicy and warming on a cold day!  I didn't much care for the tofu, but the fake beef was really yummy!  The potatoes seemed a bit undercooked to me.  It was a lot of food though, that one order turned into 2 meals for me!\n\nFor dessert I tried the chocolate cake.  I really wanted to try pandan cake, but they were all sold out!  The chocolate cake I would pass on next time.  It was pretty dry and not quite as fudgy or rich as I would have liked.

These people are TERRIBLE! They are in a bad mood, yelling at each other, and all-out rude. They didn't want to help anyone and all we needed was for them to take our info down and take our money.

The only time they seemed interested in talking was when they tried to sell us the crap they have their on their counter (tree freshener, some giant bag for throwing out the tree, etc.) and then when they told us to be sure to pay the delivery drivers (because they work on tips) for the \"free\" delivery. Of course we would tip the drivers, but the way they said it was accusatory and just flat out in bad taste.\n\nLong story shortened - Four and a half hours after our \"two hour delivery window\" (btw we can throw a rock from our house to Downtown Summerlin) we still didn't have our tree. After calling and being asked \"Are you the lady who called and cancelled?\" Huh? Yeah, we cancelled. That's why we're calling to ask for our tree. WTH? Anyway, finally I got back in the car and drove over to the lot where two EXTREMELY helpful workers (in the dark) were getting our tree ready. They did finally deliver it, but it took two trips to the lot, four or five phone calls to people who don't seem AT ALL organized and one LONG afternoon that ran until 9:30 at night.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't let these people sell trees in Downtown Summerlin EVER again. And YES! My letter is already on it's way to the Hughes Corporation, the managers of DT Summerlin, and anyone else I need to send it to in order to keep these rude money-grubbing  grinches out of our neighborhood next year.

In all my many years of Christmas tree shopping this has been the worst! Experience. I went to the Summerlin location. I went with my 2 small children who was really looking forward to getting a nice tree. We were having a nice time looking around and then we were approached by a very pushy sales man who was very!!! Rude and not very helpful and kept mentioning that he and the delivery people do not receive payment that they only receive tips and he was very pushy on that fact even though I  had every intention of tipping both of them I was upset that he had the nerve to keep mentioning it and I felt very uncomfortable. I wanted to leave but my kids really wanted a tree that day. By the way I thought it was very unprofessional that there was signs everywhere reminding people to tip the delivery men I'm very sure that anyone with common courtesy knows to give a tip. Anyway, I had a small 6 foot tree delivered the next day because it needed to be flocked and 2 extremely rude delivery men dropped it off, the tree it self was not very big at all if I had a bigger car I could have easily done it myself. There was no need for 2 men. So they proceeded to bring the tree inside the house and once it was done I was very polite and I handed them five dollars each one guy just walked out of my house very upset and the other guy looked down at the money and said, DONT YOU KNOW! We don't get paid!!! And walked out of my house really fast. I tried to stop him so I can speak to him but he was really angry and acting like I just tossed a penny on him. I had A horrible experience with a horrible sales person who I politely tipped and made no mention to the owner because I didn't want to get no one in trouble and now I had this horrible ordeal with these miserable delivery guys they insulted me in front of my children and my guests who was over to my house when they arrived. I had paid $175 for a measly 6 foot tree and they had the nerve to insult me about a five dollar tip each! So I wish I could say that was the end of a really bad story but unfortunately it gets worse. I decided to finally speak to the owner about all of this that had taken place so I called and I talked to a man named Ricky who claim to be the Manager I was so upset by the time I called him I was in tears and kindly explaining to him my situation as I am a single parent with two small children and I felt very embarrassed about what happened he seem to be very angry and upset about his workers and said that he's been getting lots of complaints about his workers practically begging for tips. He seemed very polite and very upset about everything that happened and without me asking he offered to give me a credit card refund for $70 and i excepted his kind offer and he promised me that he would refund the money that night, he said he would call me back with a confirmation. 5 days pasted! And he never called back, so I called and he finally answered and rudely told me that he had spoken to the owner and the owner said that he did not want to refund the money even though Ricky the supposed manager GIVEN HIS WORD. Then when I asked to speak to the owner he said No!! He's to busy and I'll have him call you back, then I asked what the owners name was and he told me that he didn't want to tell me his name! And he hung up on me!! I couldn't believe how horrible my overall experience was from this miserable Christmas tree farm. Please keep in mind I never asked for my money back I just wanted a apology. He offered and lied and insulting me as well and I hope that this place never opens up again. They are rude overpriced miserable liars who totally take the fun out of shopping for Christmas trees. It's sad to know that there's people out there who are like this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "09KtB2_iFe84KGft7e3aeA"}

We were excited to see the new place in the area.  The stainless steel kettles are a focal point and put us in the mood for our locally crafted beers.  The experience took a turn when our server told us that they had none of their own beers to offer.  None.  Well, that is why we were there.  She tried to sell the fact that they had a couple of exclusive micros offered.  We chose to head next door for 50 beers on tap, liqour and an extensive e menu.  Again, we were stoked at the chance to try our locally brewed beer.  No signature beer sent us packing.  We had a great time next door.\nThey say that they should have beer in 2- 3 weeks.  We will try again.  Not ready to write it off, yet.  Just disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TaKm7DeRsxz-xFVWX9XzPA"}

And I'm going to start with what I liked. The food was really good. My husband had their special of the day. It was a Short Rib over Garlic Butter Grits. He said it was the best short ribs he has ever had, and the most tender. The Pub Burger was good! I liked how the bacon mixed in with the burger meat made it fall apart yummy. Everyone thought that The Deviled Eggs were WAYYYY too salty. If the salt was toned down a little it would have been much better, might have just been a bad batch. The Mac & Cheese bites were really good, both crunchy and gooey.  The beer selection was a nice selection of rotating crafter beers. The flights were priced pretty decently. \n\nHere is where my first -1 star comes in. I called not long after they opened and made a reservation for 9 people at 7:30 that night. The girl said \"Let me check, put me on hold about 2 minutes. Came back and said \"That should be no problem! Would you like outdoor seating or in door seating.\" I told her I think in-door would be best. She said \"See you at 7:30.\"     My friend go there before me and was told that they had no reservation at 7:30 for a party of 9 under Ashley. So I came in and told them I had talked to a girl that morning that told me they even had room for inside or outside. I was then told \"Well the girl that was working up front this morning went home sick. She is the one who probably took your reservations.\" Ok... and it's not in writing anywhere? I don't understand. And the staff seemed annoyed WITH ME!? How this is all my problem I do not understand.   So even after all of this me and my 8 friends decided to stay and wait for a table to open up. It was a Saturday night and every place was going to be a wait, due to Holiday parties. We went to the bar and got some beers and flights. The bar tender was very nice and patient with us, as some of my friends were not familiar with craft beers and had to do some sampling. After we were seated, everything went very smoothly. The service was nice, the food was good, and so was the beer. \n\nMy Second -1 star is because the owner was there. I even heard him say he was going to wait on a table. In my experience, a manager/owner should have come to us and talked to us. Maybe apologized for what happened. I don't need anything for free, but at least come and speak with me. The only person who spoke with me about the entire thing was the young hostess. Who I felt bad for because its not her fault. I hope that a lot was learned from this mistake. \n\nHowever, I will be back. I really loved the atmosphere. Very chic, modern and a little bit rustic. It is very small but I don't mind that. When you walk in to the dining room you see what I think was about 8 or more long bench seats and bench type tables. Right behind those there's a Large Bar with lots of bar seating, both on the inside and outside of the bar. They had a cute little patio on the other side of the bar where we ended up sitting. They had heat lamps that worked very well and kept us pretty warm. A few lights and plants outside. I enjoyed a lot of things about this place. So I hope to come back and give this place 5 stars. But as of right now I am a little embarrassed and upset that I told my friends from out of town I had made these plans only to end up looking a little foolish. It ruined the experience a little bit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TaKm7DeRsxz-xFVWX9XzPA"}

Foremost: I am glad it's arrived. My office is conveniently nested 22 floors above, so it's nice to have a new joint for grabbing a cup of caffeine in the morning. That they sell pastries and (hooray!) wine* is icing on the cake. \n\nThat said, I have mixed emotions, which are due entirely to the fact that I \"grew up\" with the flagship store in NoDa. I spent many a'night crammed into the original, tiny space, reading a book that I didn't understand, pretending to be way more hip than I was. It has a special place in my bank of young-20-something memories and that makes the standards to which I hold any Amelie's location very high. \n\nSpecific to this location: certain aspects of the decor feel a little forced; while others seem very natural and suited to the Amelie's brand. The service is still getting it's legs beneath it, which is to be expected, but of the three times I've been in this week, two of those times came with flat-out terrible service. And the food menu is more limited than I expected, and a bit pricey (no real surprise there, and for the occassional treat it's totally worth it).\n\nStill, it's a nice change of pace in the uptown area. And poor service and high prices be damned: I will never not crave any given one of their pastries, sandwiches, tartines, and soups. The bar area is being executed nicely, too. I think the addition of booze (wine & beer) was a very wise choice, and probably my favorite part about this new location, but that could be because I'm a wino**\n\nIn summation: the Amelie's brand is an endearing one, and I am proud that it got its start in the Queen City. I'm optimistic that, as this location grows into its own, and some of the new-store-shine fades, it will deveop it's own rhythm and character, and turn into a new favorite. \n\n*but not before 5pm, right, suuuuure, nudge-nudge-wink\n\n**okay maybe not a bonafide wino, but kudos, Amelie's, for offering a nice place to \"wine\" down (see what I did there?!) after a long day in the office", "type": "review", "business_id": "XY3KhRG_0G1aL7jNWz23Dw"}

I was honored, ecstatic, and pee-in-my-pants excited!  Along with this message, I was also invited to the \"Diamonds Are A Yelper's Best Friend at Shane Co.\" that same night.  Being that it was so last minute, I had to decline.  My first day as Elite and I already missed my first YEE.  Drats!\n\nSo when I checked the Elite calendar and saw another diamond event popping up, I jumped on it.  I mean, get dressed up on a weekday, sip on some bubbly champagne, and nibble on sweets all night while being surrounded by beautiful friendly Yelpers AND sparkly diamonds?  Yas, girl.  Yaaaas!  I was on that RSVP faster than a hornet with 'roid rage!\n\nThe night started off with a warm hug from Hailey B. [sweetest CM like ever], some Yelp shwag, and a chance to enter a raffle for a pair of gorgeous earrings from Robbins Brothers.  After scoffing at an innocent piece of white paper, I grabbed a red sheet from the stack to enter my name.  Red is the color of Yelp and it's my favorite color in the world and this is important because... I WON THE EARRINGS!  AHH!  I'm glad I had placed my flute of champagne down or else Ann R. would have gotten a face full of my drink because I was cheering while showing off some impressive air punches.  I think Meagan B. was impressed by my kung fu moves.  ;)\n\nThe staff at Robbins Brothers were so sweet.  After Nicole told us about the macarons from Paris Gourmet in the back, it was a quick dash to grab the first macaron.  I nibbled on a delicate rose macaron and later shared the key lime macaron.  This made my dress flip.  Also being served was an impressive fondue bar, canel\u00e9s from Paris Gourmet, hot cocoa to warm up with, cocktail shrimp, brie en croute, and some savory crackers.  So nibbling on noms and champagne-sipping while Nicole let us try on rings while being patient with a bunch of rowdy Yelpers was how we spent our night.  It was perfect.  We also got our jewelry cleaned for free while we got to peruse their gorgeous collection and sit through various informative classes.\n\nThank you Yelp, Hailey B., and the kind and wonderful staff at Robbins Brothers for a beautiful Thursday night!  It definitely gave me that festive cheer and might I add, after seeing their black diamonds collection, I wouldn't mind coming back!  Best of luck to their newest location here in the valley!\n\n\"I never worry about diets.

I also really loved learning about diamonds and the \"4 C's\" that rate a diamond's quality.  It was also interesting to see how just a change in the overhead lights a store uses can vastly alter the way a diamond appears.  So you have to be careful and look at your diamond in \"white\" or \"natural\" light!

When we got home and opened the bag the onion rings were missing. I guess we should have eaten there. The burgers were ok, mine almost tasted like it had been pan fried a little too long. I didn't care for the consistency of the burger either, Alina thought it was fine. The fries are really thin, and were good when they were hot. Because we got ours to go, they had cooled off by the time we got to them (after sampling a few in the car) and they weren't very good anymore.

Heartbroken that my beloved Parma had closed (I had a 4x/week habit for a time), I was eager to be one of the first patrons at Chef Marc's new Trattoria. Just entering the restaurant sets the mood. He's turned an overly curtained and tassled Indian venue into an elegant room - sophisticated, welcoming, warm, with the perfect lighting for a romantic date night. The menu has gotten an upgrade, though Chef says he's still deciding what stays and what goes. While you'll find traditional fare - alfredo, manicotti, ravioli - these all feature Marc's fresh made pasta and unrivaled Sunday sauce. He definitely has offerings for the more sophisticated - linguine Nero with squid ink pasta and artichoke hearts with a kick. I tried the linguine and clams and my date went with the veal parmesan which took up the entire plate for about half the price you'd find elsewhere. It was one of these \"there's no way I'm finishing this whole thing\" that turned into \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing, but it was so delicious and now I can't move.\" The service is, as expected, amazing, featuring some of the old Parma crew that made dining with them feel like being at home with a (functional) Italian family. \n\nChef Marc himself chatted with us a bit about the menu and we were enraptured by his descriptions of how he dreams up and executes each dish. The passion he exudes consumes you and, before I knew it, I was cheering him on as he described each step of his craft. \"Yeah, sauteed chanterelles, then what? Oh yeah, a little white wine and garlic? Fresh pasta? Hell YES.\" \n\nWhile I'll miss the deli and the little retail store that unfailingly had my obscure Italian ingredients for my pathetically short-falling home cooking, I look forward to how this venture develops. \n\nSo glad Chef Marc is back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1s6YBE96-tRIdOFU8humaA"}

I called the meatball issue to the attention of the waitress but she didn't seem concerned and just walked off, not to return again.

She also forgot one of our drink orders we had to remind her of, then she still brought the wrong thing even though she had written down the original order.We had to get her attention many times before she could finally bring the check. It took about 30 min from when we first asked her to finally get it.  She seemed to have trouble using the machine to check us out and there was only one machine that could be used at a time.  She didn't apologize at all (not about the meatballs lacking cheese or about the delays or forgotten drink orders) until the very end when she finally produced the check and she took the meatballs off of it.

Having a decent beer selection from a retail space would be a nice add in the neighborhood\n- Semi-limited bagged coffee offerings (bulk); I assume the staff will make you a bag of whatever is on-hand upon request\n\n+ Same Barriques food menu - wraps, salads, bakery goods\n+ Same friendly Barriques staff\n+ Same high quality Barriques feel\n\nSuggestions: more bagged/bulk coffee, maybe add beer (if it isn't there), relocate a few of the tables to allow for more room by the fireplace and behind the bar area near the cashiers (those hightop chairs bump directly into the table behind them).\n\nPro tip: There's a self-serve water fountain with glasses to the right of the cashier area, near the high-tech espresso machine\n\nAll-in-all, one of the best Barriques I've ever been to.

Thank you to My Escape Mission and Yelp for the excellent event!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YcxCrP6tOCWOJjMk1evyzQ"}

I have not been to The Wise yet, but will certainly check it out now that I have sampled some of the fare. My favorite items were the homemade dipping sauces - a slightly spicy honey and creamy mustard paired perfectly with the small bites platter. \n\nThe event was great at creating relationships among \"eliters\". Nothing like being locked in a room, that I swear was increasing in temperature, to bond complete strangers together. When I see my team at other events, we will have the \"remember when we were locked in that room\" forever among us! :) \n\nAnd lastly, our host - \"the great one\" totally made the night.

The only thing I did not get to do at last week's event was have a meal. Well never fear all four restaurants serve Sunday brunch from 10-3!\n\nI stopped over here to do some last minute strip browsing and went inside. Off to the left as you enter there is a brewery bar. As you enter there are 4 food court style stations where you can order off each of their menus. This is a unique concept style chef food court new to our area.\n\nThis place is now officially open and the four chefs are in preparation for 18 months of preparing different seasonal offerings before they go on to open their own establishment here in Pittsburgh. I did ask if these chefs were going on to other cities and I was told no, they will open up somewhere else in the city after the 18 months and then 4 new chefs in training will replace them.\n\nThe current businesses are \"Provision\",\"Carota cafe\", \"Josephine's' toast\", and \"Aubergine.\"  I perused the menus and decided to go with Carota cafe but I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed with any of them.\n\nI met up again with Jessica Lewis of Carota cafe. She specializes in home grown fresh vegetables but will add some meat to her offerings. She had a special brunch menu but she had the octopus salad available. I opted for that and for some chocolate Babka for dessert. Her drinks consisted of a choice of either carrot or orange juice or a warmed infused chicken broth. She let me sample the broth but I was really wasn't impressed with it so I pulled a bottle of ice tea from the common refrigerator they share.\n\nI told her I haven't had good octopus since I had been in NYC and wanted to see if she would top that. I paid her and she in turn took down my cell phone number because the businesses text you when your order is ready.\n\nI had my food in no time flat and rather than sit in the bar area I sat in the back area where they have picnic style wooden tables with a view outside. My octopus was to die for! As I was eating I met up with the owner of the establishment who welcomed me and asked me if there was anything I needed. He got me some straws from the bar area to finish my iced tea. The salad was not too big and left enough room for that delicious chocolate Babka. \"Seinfeld\" fans will know where that pastry originated from. It was just enough for me. \n\nA clean up man came over and offered to take away my plates. He said normally you would take them to an area set up that collects trash and of course you can place your used dishes in them. I thought that was so nice of him.\n\nThis is one of the best additions to the strip and am anxious to see it grow. Next visit I will enjoy a meal from one of the other 3 chefs. It is located on Smallman St near the Catholic church.  Street and bike parking are available. If you prefer then you can park a few blocks away in the garage above Marty's market for a nominal fee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nPvwk6NW7j-nbvUzCh94lw"}

The Smallman Galley brings a new concept to the old fashioned food court idea by bringing in local chefs to prepare signature dishes for a period of time.\n\nWe were greeted with two complimentary drink coupons upon arrival. They have 4 parallel open kitchens where you can see the different eateries. Immediately to the left of that is the bar area. I asked for the specialty drink of the night and was told it was a rum ginger syrup and honey sparkling wine. It was out of this world!\n\nRachel then introduced us to the four chefs who would give a short introduction of their business and the samples we would be tasting. Jacqueline Wardle of Josephine's toast explained how her offerings are made on toast and we were given a sample of her salad.\n\nRafael Venola was up next explaining Aubergine bistro. Got to sample a marinated white anchovy. Not sure where these samples came from since they were passed after the presentation but all were very good.\n\nSteven Eldrige then explained Provision (menu was so small on chalkboard they had to put one in their display window). He does an interpretation of American food. We got to sample a chicken skin biscuit Bhn mi. Very different!  Finally, Jessica Lewis of Carota cafe. She is vegetable focused gathering her food from local farms but does have a nice selection. Her favorites we were told were carrot soup (sampled that-so good and healthy!), octopus, and even sampled a different type of chocolate chip cookie!\n\nAfter the presentation and the samples we were told we could order what we wish and eat in the back area where there were wooden picnic style tables. We were given an opportunity to press and write thank you notes to small businesses c/o  Sapling Press. I could have written a bunch of them but I was told to choose one and put the name of the business on it and they would mail it.\n\nI got an opportunity to meet new friends and have a great evening. As always, I got too full on all the samples but it merits a return trip which I will do after the holidays.\n\nThe Concept of the Galley is that after 18 months as these chefs prepare to open new restaurants new chefs will come in to take their place. Located at 2016 Smallman St, you can also enter on 21st st. Street parking is available but if you prefer there is a small pay garage nearby on top of Marty's Market. \n\nThanks again to Rachel and all the Yelp staff for making this event a holiday present I'll never forget!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DeS-atRfeSwiSHhJSMdWUA"}

This interesting concept is featuring some talented new chefs, and we dined exceptionally well. The idea here is to create a platform for emerging talent so new chefs have an opportunity to hone their chops and learn about the business end of the restaurant world before starting up their own brick and mortar places. Each chef gets 18 months, and then there will be new chefs coming in as the previous ones leave for, hopefully, their own ventures. The talent was obvious, and the excitement and energy palpable. We were treated to complementary small bites from each chef and a selection of beer and libations. Just one of the perks of spending all this time writing reviews for Yelp, and a good reason to become elite, for those of you not yet in the groove. The drink they were featuring was a yummy concoction with rum, gin, ginger, honey and sparkling wine over ice. Very refreshing and well balanced. \n\nAfter sampling some food and looking at each chef's menus, my husband was really excited by what Chef Rafael Vencio was cooking up, so we ordered some food from him.

Yelp knocked it out of the park with this event! To start, the decor and setup was perfect for the event size. The large side room, along with smaller tables spread throughout the Galley, had lots of Yelp swag for grabs. Kuzies, bottle opener keychains, hand sanitizer in a neat yelp holder and Yelpstick (for our chapped winter lips!) There was also a local company letting us hand press thank you cards that we filled out with holiday greetings to our favorite local business and Yelp mailed them out!\n\n To be expected with the gift of two free drink tickets, the bar was packed in the beginning but once the guests got a drink & Rachel made an announcement about the dining room, the crowd spaced out and had plenty of room to mingle. The long family style dinner table made for a great spot to get to know a fellow Elites and their guests.\n\nThe concept of the night was an opportunity for 4 new chefs in the area to showcase their foodie vision. Each of them has a separate kiosk style kitchen in the Galley with their menu & explanation of their cooking style. Before they started passing hors d'oeuvres they each introduced themself, how they landed in Pittsburgh and their cooking style. This event and proceeds from their sales help them save for their own restaurant one day!\n\nA few of the hors d'oeuvres were heavy on gluten so I passed but I did try a delicious carrot soup from Carota cafe. From talking with other guests, none of us were disappointed with the samples!\n\nAfter the hors d'oeuvres, each guest had the opportunity to order from the kitchens. We ordered and were notified via text when our food was ready. I found this method to be efficient and well executed. Crowds didn't form waiting for food and we could continue mingling until we got our text. \n\nI opted for smothered fries from Provision kitchen. This kitchen has gluten free and vegetarian notations so that's what sold it for me. The bottom layer of the dish was winter squash puree and the fresh & crispy fries were topped with seasoned lentils and pickled onion. Goat cheese was included but I got it on the side for my friend since I couldn't eat it. Wow, this twist on smothered fries was full of unexpected flavor due to the combination of lentils & creamy squash. I look forward to going back for this dish in the future. My friend opted for a dish from Josephine's toast where everything is served on a different type of toast. She got chicken, escarole, potatoes & parmesan on garlic toast and it didn't disappoint. \n\nKudos, Yelp! This event was wonderful! The 4 chefs are incredibly talented and I couldn't be more delighted that they brought their skills to the great Steel City!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DeS-atRfeSwiSHhJSMdWUA"}

My husband hates things that are too fishy but he really enjoyed this dish. \n\nI wasn't drinking tonight but the bartender William was able to hook me up with a ginger based non-alcoholic cocktail that kept me coming back for more. Literally 3 more!! I'm so happy this place was featured for a yelp event because I love a place with options. \n\nThanks Rachel C. for the amazing intro of Smallman Galley, I look forward to coming back really soon!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DeS-atRfeSwiSHhJSMdWUA"}

Who would ever have guessed just a few years ago that Pittsburgh would be named the top city in the U.S. on the restaurant front. \n\nTalk about innovative restaurant concepts! Smallman Gallery is an incubator for the talents of four chefs, each developing his or her own concept, and working towards opening their individual spots at the end of the next 18 months. When these four chefs have completed their tours of Galley duty, another four chefs will take over the helms and the incubation process will begin again. \n\nThe space itself is large, brick walled, industrial, yet warm. The communal tables that parallel the gorgeous copper-topped bar make for a comfortable spot to enjoy your selection of food items along with a well-made cocktail, beer or non alcoholic drink.  (Might I mention here that it's a GREAT place to see everything...prime people watching!) We Yelpers filled every inch of that side and spilled into an adjoining space filled with tables. THIS is a space for one hell of a private event!\n\nI can't wait to enjoy a meal, picked from all 4 menus, when they open officially. I saw gluten free items that I'm looking forward to.

During this event we got a change to get a sneak peek of the brand new Smallman Galley.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is rustic and modern at the same time and such a nice space. It is much more spacious than it looks from the outside too.\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived we snagged a couple of seats at the bar. The \"Yelp\" cocktail was very tasty and had a nice kick to it. It featured rum, gin, ginger, honey and sparkling wine over ice and was topped with cinnamon. Veronica was one of the bartenders working during the event and she took excellent care of us the entire evening and kept the drinks flowing. I love a good cocktail and these were absolutely incredible.\n\nSmallman Galley is very new and innovative dining concept. It features four different \"kitchens\" where four unique up and coming chefs get to hone their entrepreneur skills for 18 months with a ultimate goal of opening their very own restaurants once the 18 months are up. Then a new group of aspiring chefs will come in and the process begins all over again.\n\nDuring the event a appetizer from each of the four kitchens were pasted around. First we got to try Chef Stephen Eldridge of Provision's Bahn Mi (fried chicken skin) It was my favorite. Next we got to try Jessica Lewis of Carota cafe's carrot soup. We also got to try Chef Rafael Vencio of Aubergine Bistro's White anchovy small bites. They were quite unique.\n\nAfter the samples were finished being served I made my way over to Provision and ordered the two of us a couple of Umami Burgers. It features a locally made beef patty, simple greens, Parmesan Frica, smoked mushrooms, Umami aioli, Cheddar cheese all served on a Challah roll with a side of fries. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life!

This event is in my top five events ever. This event tops the Ten Penny holiday party from last year. Why? Because Smallman Galley is awesome, it's unique, and it's a great addition to Pittsburgh.\n\nSmallman Galley is a brand new spot that, according to the website, is \"a launch pad for the best new restaurant concepts in Pittsburgh.\" 4 chefs have come together here in four small kitchen spaces, and each are in the process of developing a great menu. Over the coming months people will be able to come here and sample all of the food available at these four kitchens - while also enjoying items from a shared bar! - as the chefs get their ducks in a row and look into opening in their own local businesses.\n\nDuring this event I had a chance to visit this brand new spot, enjoy some free drinks, and sample some lite bites from each kitchen - and then we had the chance to actually purchase items on the menus. I admit, I'm usually all about the free stuff. But this time, I was more excited to purchase something than I was about the samples!\n\nThe samples were good, of course: carrot soup, salad on toast, anchovy bites and spicy chicken biscuits. All were delicious - no complaints from me there. But oh man, was my main course great! I, like others, opted for smothered fries from Provision kitchen. And smothered they were - smothered in goat cheese, pickled onion, and lentils and creamy squash. Wow. Just, wow! Every single item in this stack of food was fresh/cooked to perfection, too. I legit thought about ordering a second helping. That's how great they were.\n\nEverything about this event was absolutely wonderful - it's a wonderful concept in a wonderful space that's home to some wonderful chefs. Rachel's idea of giving us the chance to write thank you letters to local businesses, by the way, brought the whole event home and was a perfect touch for the holidays.

The cheese plate we started with was quite nice, and the the avocado salad bites - as well as the the meatballs with pita - were delicious. But the real show stealers in my mind were the Ahi tuna bites on crispy wontons. So. Good! I ate those tuna bites every single time they came to our tables throughout the night. I literally have no idea how many of them I ate. But it was a lot!\n\nAs others have mentioned, we also sampled a Gin & Tonic with cranberries and a Gin Martini.

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.  I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \n\nMy biggest gripe?  Price.  My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.  That's a little steep for standard breakfast fare...\n\nBreakfast is served all-day long on Saturday and Sunday; during the week it's served until 11am, at which point it's lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, I believe).", "type": "review", "business_id": "W9TgasYwecd_yavQit4dkQ"}

We sent the plates back and while they added a bit of seasoning it was still not \"Prairie hash\" and they threw the same eggs on grill to rewarm so now my medium eggs were hard. Maybe the new grill isn't seasoned enough yet. They also now clear the tables for you, instead of having a station for you to dump your own. Twenty minutes after we eere done someone came and cleared our plates away. I sincerely hope they find the old mojo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "W9TgasYwecd_yavQit4dkQ"}

It used to be one of my most favorite places for coffee, bake goods, and breakfast. Food was still excellent, we had a scramble and it was excellent. Food still is great, but, the new beauty full facilities has major problem. I have not been in such a load environment for eating for a long time. In looking at the internal construction there is no sound absorbing or muffling materials anywhere. The restaurant is an Eco chamber. Than to top it off they where constantly grinding what I initially thought was coffee but it turned out to be some kind of smoothy. Than a worker showed up without her proper tee shirt on and the manger had to yell over the smoothy machine for her to get her work shirt on and get to work. He of course had to yell since the smoothy machine was going so all the customers got to witness the entire exchange. The tables are much more spread out and the tables are big. But because of that I could not talk across the wide table in such a noisy enviorment. The design to have the kitchen out in the open makes the noise of food prep  a big problem. The feel of the old place is gone. \nThey can now handle more customers but the dinning experience is greatly reduced. I came across town from the east side to dine here, but going forward I will only be going here if it happens to be on my way to somewhere.  I hope Prairie can address the loss of comfort they used to have, it will take a real effort and defiantly some extensive attention to sound dampening.", "type": "review", "business_id": "W9TgasYwecd_yavQit4dkQ"}

Finally!!!! Yay!\n+ Friendly staff \n+ More outdoor seating than before\n+ The toast.

Place was locked-up tighter than a drum. No signs about holiday vacation, no mention anywhere. Just dark (at 9:30am). Not cool.\n- While they have Colectivo coffee, it's brewed far too weak. It's so thin and anemic, that all variants taste nearly identical to one another.\n- Do the scrambles-of-the-day ever change, or do I manage to visit when the same scramble is featured (every.dang.time.)?\n- Scramblers have become quite greasy. Past two visits left my plate with a solid sheen of oil.\n\nBut my biggest gripe (aside from weak coffee and greasier than before food): logistics of the coffee station/order counter area. Why are they so close to one another, thus making it nearly impossible during busier times to get coffee or to get up to the counter (to ask a question or request a to go container)? The distance between the order counter and the coffee area is maybe two-people wide, so it gets crowded quickly in that area. It's also the only area for garbage/recycling, which makes it all the more busy.  :-(\n\nI'm quickly running out of favorite west-side breakfast haunts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "W9TgasYwecd_yavQit4dkQ"}

The chipotle sauce that it comes with is excellent and I could have used a touch more on my burrito. It comes with a side of salsa verde which was awesome. Not sure if it was housemade or not but it sure tasted like it! My sister had the burrito with black beans, red/green peepers (I can't remember what it was called and is not on the online menu for some reason even though it was not a special-though after a second glance I notice the carnitas burrito is not listed either...CAUTION: website menu is not updated).

That being said, my expectations are high.  The best of the best in my opinion is...wait for it...Giant Eagle. Yep.  I love the sugary sweet icing and the texture of their cakes.  BUT, Butterwood is giving GE a run for their batter.  I stopped in on Saturday with some family to complement our delicious and decadent dinner from Dive.  Among our choices were a Cranberry [short] cake (literally - it was short), cinnamon/chocolate cake; vanilla/sunflower seed and chocolate/sweet potato.  I split the sunflower seed and sweet potato options and DANG, these are GOOD cakes!  They're so dense and flavorful I actually couldn't finish - which is VERY unlike me.  Take a pic, because now that a bakery is open down the street from me until ELEVEN PM, I'll be twice my size in no time. At $6+ a pop, I might also be broke, but I'll also be happy - so bring on the Butterwood\n\nP.S. I got our cakes to go, but look forward to eating in next time.

The only way to make it better: add the holidays and some bubbly.\n\nThe market brought in dozens of amazing local vendors to set up for this pop up market. I know there were some complaints about the crowd. Personally, watching so many people come out to support local businesses was incredible. I just don't think there's such a thing as too much. The biggest problem was the very beginning because people mobbed trying to get their hands on a free glass of champs. Come on people, just go buy a drink. \n\nI bought a couple of really neat presents. I can write about both of them here because 1) I already gave Lauren's hers and 2) Hudson is a year and a half and cannot read this. For Lauren, I got a really cool hand-painted pallet sign about mermaids. For little Huddy Bear, I bought two books: the ABCs of Charlotte and the 123s of Charlotte. The authors signed both books for him. Very cool.\n\nSo, what do you need to know for this event: the market validates parking for 7th Street Station, but it's only good for 90 minutes. You'll have to pay for parking if you go past 90 minutes. If you plan to eat, take your food outside!! It gets pretty busy inside and there's limited places to grub. \n\nShout out to Toni, Chris, Ben, all the regular market vendors, and all the pop ups for a fun evening.

Being on Stanley between de Maisonneuve and Sainte Catherine, you're already in a difficult position if you drive, because parking is in short supply, and construction has cut down the number of spots even more.  The inside of the store makes it worthwhile, it's really beautiful, and it was a great location for a Yelp event.\n\nI really liked the clothing donation aspect as well.  Frank & Oak are starting a program where they will match clothing donations, so we were all encouraged to bring coats, sweaters, and socks!  It really made me feel included, and allowed me to give something back, which you know, gives me that warm fuzzy feeling inside.\n\nIt was great to see other fellow Yelpers and meet new people, I always love the Yelp community spirit!\n\nThe food and drinks were very nice too, I haven't had a maple cream in a really long time.

Je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0 Frank & Oak, ayant \"d\u00e9couvert\" par hasard leur boutique sur St-Viateur en allant au caf\u00e9 N\u00e9v\u00e9, mais cette succursale sur Stanley est beaucoup plus spacieuse ! Au cours de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement, j'ai eu l'occasion de visiter la boutique en compagnie d'un styliste (Arkadi, vraiment attentionn\u00e9 !) qui m'a donn\u00e9 de judicieux conseils et un bel aper\u00e7u des services et produits disponibles en boutique (et en ligne). D\u00e8s notre entr\u00e9e, on peut prendre un petit caf\u00e9 \u00e0 siroter pendant notre s\u00e9ance de magasinage. Il y a aussi un barbier au 2e \u00e9tage. Leur Hunt Club me semble un service vraiment int\u00e9ressant : pour 20$ par an, on peut recevoir des v\u00eatements \u00e0 essayer chez soi. On ne paye que ce qui nous pla\u00eet et le reste peut \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 sans frais ! Les v\u00eatements sont \u00e0 bon prix et de belle qualit\u00e9. C'est vraiment un lieu qui m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre d\u00e9couvert. Merci \u00e0 toute l'\u00e9quipe de Yelp Montr\u00e9al et aux employ\u00e9s de Frank & Oak pour cette belle soir\u00e9e !", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZPXghJnhfEnA_pqukVzNHg"}

I signed up with my brother's name for email newsletters. Nobody I know wears Frank & Oak, you know why? Because no man I know is stylish enough to care.\n\nIf I can support our Canadian brand in any way, I would. I love the idea behind the company, I love the clothes they make. So when Yelp partnered up with Frank & Oak, I was beyond happy!! But wait a minute, I still don't know any man stylish enough to care!!!! (even though I talk about you all the time!!!)\n\nThen it occurred to me that my Belgium classmate receives compliments about his style EVERYWHERE he goes. I signed him up as my +1 and OMG did we have an amazing time.\n\nThe store is fabulous!!!!! THREE FLOORS, you must be kidding me!!!!!!!! This is unreal! Most delicious sandwiches ever, I had seconds! In fact I had four \"seconds!\" The warm wine upstairs is delicious. I also had seconds.\n\nStaff is courteous. So fantastic. And WOW thank you so much for the generosity with donations!!! What a beautiful idea and just in time for Christmas! Even though I moved recently with little precious clothing, I managed to find something to donate. Again if I can support this lovely Canadian brand in any way, I would! I'm super proud of you.\n\nThank you Risa for this incredible evening! LOTS OF LOVES XO", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZPXghJnhfEnA_pqukVzNHg"}

However, not being a dude myself, I never really felt a pressing need to check these guys out until this event. \n\nFirst, I love that F&O are a local brand. Second, I like that they incorporate other local brands into their concept - think Nev\u00e9 and Cherc's, for example. Now let's get down to business. The space is spread out onto three floors; on the main floor, you'll find some awesome quality clothing and the caf\u00e9. Next up, the barber shop on the 2nd floor - I think there might be some clothes up there too, but I was distracted by all the beards around me so can't say for sure. Finally, the 3rd floor is where the fellows can try on their gear and get more personalized service such as the help of a stylist. The shop is simple but cool, urban, most definitely hipster-inspired. It's basically a one-stop shop for the guys, in the downtown core, something that was lacking.\n\nThe F&O guys were super friendly, the DJ kicked ass, and the food was damn good! I went back for like, five helpings of 'seconds.' Hey don't judge! Grilled cheese. Mmmmm. Anyway, we also got to try some mulled wine and the barista was ready to whip up your coffee of choice, on demand. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'll pop in for a quick coffee once in a while. OK, maybe be it'll be for the eye candy...\n\nGreat event - thanks RD!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZPXghJnhfEnA_pqukVzNHg"}

Let's just say, good things, without a doubt, come to those who wait! My first step into this Amelie's was equivalent to rubbing your eyes Christmas morning to reveal a mountain of shiny presents. I was utterly delighted with a spark in my twinkling eyes. \n\nLet's begin with the space. This used to be an old cafeteria that lost its spark years ago, and lacked the tender, love and care it needed. I would constantly walk by when it was being renovated. Seeing how Amelie's has transformed the space from its nascent, melancholy state, to the beautiful, artistic ambiance it now radiates, is amazing. They did a great job of utilizing all of the space and even implemented an event/banquet space upstairs. There's plenty of room in the open space and even quieter areas if you need to study. I can't wait to use the patio when it's warmer! Without a doubt, I'm in love. \n\nNow to the important part, the bakery! Despite the novel space, Amelie's still retains its roots of delicious macarons, salted caramel brownies, fruit tarts and everything near and dear to its origin. The delicious, creative drinks still linger on the walls inside golden frames and yes, the kitchen still makes those delicious soups and sandwiches! Actually, I believe this where they are making most, if not all, of the delicious treats to be distributed to their other stores. \n\nLast, and possibly the most highly anticipated part, this Amelie's serves wine and beer! And you thought Amelie's couldn't get any better :)\n\nI'm so proud of Amelie's and how far it has gone since its first opening. I saw Amelie's when it was the local's best kept secret gem. Now, they've expanded to several locations, and even cities! I hope they continue to expand and one day, I'll have the opportunity to say that it all started right here in my hometown, Charlotte, North Carolina!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LRxgLNxp8lpAu2p7Swpquw"}

Foremost: I am glad it's arrived. My office is conveniently nested 22 floors above, so it's nice to have a new joint for grabbing a cup of caffeine in the morning. That they sell pastries and (hooray!) wine* is icing on the cake. \n\nThat said, I have mixed emotions, which are due entirely to the fact that I \"grew up\" with the flagship store in NoDa. I spent many a'night crammed into the original, tiny space, reading a book that I didn't understand, pretending to be way more hip than I was. It has a special place in my bank of young-20-something memories and that makes the standards to which I hold any Amelie's location very high. \n\nSpecific to this location: certain aspects of the decor feel a little forced; while others seem very natural and suited to the Amelie's brand. The service is still getting it's legs beneath it, which is to be expected, but of the three times I've been in this week, two of those times came with flat-out terrible service. And the food menu is more limited than I expected, and a bit pricey (no real surprise there, and for the occassional treat it's totally worth it).\n\nStill, it's a nice change of pace in the uptown area. And poor service and high prices be damned: I will never not crave any given one of their pastries, sandwiches, tartines, and soups. The bar area is being executed nicely, too. I think the addition of booze (wine & beer) was a very wise choice, and probably my favorite part about this new location, but that could be because I'm a wino**\n\nIn summation: the Amelie's brand is an endearing one, and I am proud that it got its start in the Queen City. I'm optimistic that, as this location grows into its own, and some of the new-store-shine fades, it will deveop it's own rhythm and character, and turn into a new favorite. \n\n*but not before 5pm, right, suuuuure, nudge-nudge-wink\n\n**okay maybe not a bonafide wino, but kudos, Amelie's, for offering a nice place to \"wine\" down (see what I did there?!) after a long day in the office", "type": "review", "business_id": "LRxgLNxp8lpAu2p7Swpquw"}

The decor and ambiance is true to the Am\u00e8lie's brand (blue, quirky, flea-market-chic and whimsical), but everything is just newer. All the employees are obviously excited to be there; it's got that \"yay! We've just opened and we're all excited!\" vibe to it. \n\nThe split-level layout makes for plenty of seating and there are plenty of nooks and crannies that allow for privacy if you're wanting some quiet to study/work or converse. \n\nMy rating is more 4.5 stars because I've had better pastries. They try to be authentically French, but I find something amiss. I mean, it's still good, but bring a native French person here and I could see them saying something similar. \n\nTons of gorgeous natural lighting thanks to the tall windows, wonderful aromas and tastes of coffee and pastries, whimsical music. What's not to like?\n\n(Tip: try the Brown Butter Pecan caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me! It's divine!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "LRxgLNxp8lpAu2p7Swpquw"}

Consistent design and very spacious place as all their other locations. Staff tries to be friendly but very unprofessional. I had to pick my pastry and stay in the line to pay for it (with it in my hands). At the register I ordered one drink ( I was sold for its extravagant name) but couldn't get information about its content, 2 of the register attendants did not know the product. After I paid I went to the bar to wait for my order. Since it was 10 min after I ordered my drink, I started eating my desert, that unfortunately looked much better than tasted. Really heavy and flavorless filling in a soggy burnt shell. It definitely stayed in the fridge for a couple of days. Finally when I got my drink it wasn't what I ordered and it took them a while to figure out why it happened and to exchange it for the right thing. I think the general opinion of this place is overestimated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LRxgLNxp8lpAu2p7Swpquw"}

The space is huge, beautifully decorated, and can accommodate a lot of people without making patrons feel cramped or claustrophobic. \n\nAmelie's uptown location serves the same stellar food, including amazing baked delectables and stellar tea and coffee as the NoDa location, but is smack in the middle of Charlotte's central business district. \n\nWhile I didn't partake in the consumption of any adult beverages this morning, Amelie's is definitely going to be added to a list of places to duck in for a glass of wine after work or before attending an event at one of the nearby cultural venues. I'm not sure how extensive the wine list is, but I know they serve bubbly -which is all I really need. \n\nAmelie's checks a lot of boxes for me... If you're uptown and in a rush for a quick bite or some caffeine, get Amelie's to go. If you're uptown and need a quiet space for self reflection -find a quiet corner of Amelie's, bring some earbuds, and enjoy the free wifi. If you're uptown and need to have an informal business meeting, go to Amelie's and enjoy their diverse selection of couches, bistro tables,  and other seating options. Whatever you do, just go to Amelie's!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LRxgLNxp8lpAu2p7Swpquw"}

It's big and beautiful inside. The food is amazing just like all the other Cafe Rios. Because it's new, the lines are long around lunch and dinner time so expect 10 mins or so. The line keeps moving though so don't sweat it.  Also parking is limited due to construction but there are more spots out behind the building. \n\nI really enjoy the salads but make sure and tell them shredded lettuce because its more bite sized. Also ask for a scoop of Fresca sauce if you want to add a little spicy salsa.\n\nBurritos are good too but get them to put pico and lettuce inside. Always get it enchilada(smothered) style so they send it through and melt down the cheese and sauce. I usually do mild(green sauce) with the chicken or seafood and the red sauce with Pork or beef as its a bit sweet.\n\nSo happy to have a location down the street from my house now.

Some great sandwiches. Soups, chilies. Desserts. Whatever.  They have it. It's a place I will keep visiting. I'm posting several pics too so you can see but this place is better than 5 starts. If you live anywhere near Chandler GO NOW!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "i0qvOlxRMYTYm0ZG4BEulg"}

Seriously. And I'm so happy to see it finally open!! What a gorgeous restaurant! And great food! I can tell already that they will be a wonderful addition to the Madison food scene. \n\nFirst up, the atmosphere: It's beautiful inside. It feels like a place you'd want to hang out. More tables than bar space, but that works considering their menu! Asian themed without being too in your face or stereotyping.\n\nThe drinks: I loved the Tokyo mule! Just the right amount of spice for me, with the fun choice of soju instead of vodka. I also got the mono no aware, which was good too, but perhaps a little too complex to have with dinner. Lots of good flavor layers. Andrew at the bar was very nice and checked in with me to make sure everything was good.\n\nThe food: Woo! All your favorites from Umami are here too! The classic pork buns, renamed the \"o.g.\" pork buns here, accurately, are still on point. I tried to get the new and different options though, so I left the awesome ramen for another day and sampled the korean spicy wings (split with another), the chicken bun (split), the sashimi, and the beef noodle soup. Amazingly, it didn't end up being too much food... Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but definitely good for this trial experience! \nThe crispiness of wings was very good, but could have just a little more time in the marinade. The chicken bun was very yummy, but... I think I would choose the pork bun over it. How can you pass up those pork buns?!?!? Definitely worth getting though, and now I'm considering a future where I just get buns for dinner... The sashimi was good, but a little expensive for my tastes. 6 pieces for $16 is a hefty price tag, even though they were fresh and good sized pieces. Finally, the beef noodle soup. Pretty good! Udon noodles, to me, aren't exactly the right noodles to go with that soup (I prefer skinny noodles) but the broth was very good. I was hesitant since the menu mentioned some spices I don't normally associate with beef noodle soup, but it was very well balanced!\n\nThe service: The one drawback to our experience. Not that this was bad service at all (but my friends also tell me I'm too nice about this sort of thing, so be your own judge)! Seems like they've just got some kinks to work out. Our group of six first got seated at the sushi bar. Okay, cool view, but kind of odd because then we couldn't actually talk, so we requested to change to a table, which they were very nice about. The ordering was a bit hapazard--my side of the table ordered appetizers and the other side ordered their full meals, which we figured out after a little while and caught up on ordering, but that meant our food came out at weird times. There also was some confusion on what we ordered and who ordered what; one of my friends got served another table mates' order and proceeded to eat it, thinking he misordered, and we only discovered the mixup when his original entree showed up. Again, they were very nice about it and comped the meal of the poor guy without a dinner, but definitely unexpected!\n\nFirst night jitters? Overall, TL;DR: we will be back! Good food, great atmosphere, they might just need a little time to settle into being open!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NRJ4iF8KIXKH2u_0nW2Brg"}

Of course I had to go opening week, and perhaps due to that newness factor, I had the unfortunate experience of suffering through some definite issues that need fixing. First, positives- the space is strikingly beautiful, the menu had something for everyone, and our server was very sweet and attentive in the face of what was probably a really stressful night for her.  My boyfriend declared his General Tso's Chicken ($14) flawless, and my daughter went with the classic miso ramen, which was every bit as good as it is at Umami (Tavernakaya's sister spot).  \n\nNow, the issues- the one thing everyone in our party was irritated by was that it was absolutely freezing in the restaurant.  Most tables around us complained; we just kept our winter coats on. The glass doors which make up the front of the space, seemingly designed to give TK (as our server kept calling it) an inside/out feel in warmer seasons, don't shut all the way- or weren't properly sealed- whatever the issue, a 32 degree breeze was drifting through the dining room the whole time.  Secondly, when my friend ordered her sushi roll, we were warned that it would take some time. Our server said sushi was running 40 minutes to an hour wait. She ordered it anyway.  Her roll (just one maki roll) did indeed take an hour, but to Tavernakaya's credit, they did not charge her for it- which was a welcome and appropriate surprise.  \n\nI've been to several other izakaya style restaurants and totally love them- I especially like robata skewers and the shareable plate style menu- so I appreciate what Tavernakaya's trying to do, but the skewers I ordered were both problematic. Shiitake mushrooms were bone dry and extremely salty- and $8 for 8 small mushrooms total (about 4 to a skewer).  That portion at that price didn't seem apace with the pork belly skewers, which were also $8 and probably twice the size, and accompanied with a fantastic spicy mustard. Alas, the pieces of pork belly- nearly all of them, all but one in fact- had tiny chunks of bone in them, which made it hard to enjoy, especially off a skewer.  I ordered hot sake; it came out cold; I said I'd drink it anyway.  Second hot sake also came out cold.  Our poor server finally admitted they didn't really have a \"hot\" sake- only \"warm\" and chilled. Timing and service aside from our main server was weird- over the course of the night, 3 other people dropped food and drinks at our table, and I do mean dropped. Everything came out separately (not a single plate came out at the same time) and was set on our table unceremoniously and silently (followed by the surly expediter abruptly turning away).   After eating the two sets of skewers, I was still quite hungry, so figured I'd pony up for a large plate.  I ordered the Miso Salmon ($19) which was described as broiled miso-marinated salmon with bok choy.  That's exactly what it was. What it wasn't: a \"large plate.\" I wouldn't even call it a lunch portion.  The salmon was okay- good flavor- but the bok choy was literally one stalk of baby bok choy, sliced in half, steamed to a slightly tough al dente with no sauce, butter, or seasoning to speak of.  Quite bizarre- almost as though it had been microwaved.  The salmon itself was about half the size I'd expect for that price. (or as my friend pointed out, about a third the size of Tempest's entree salmon- maybe 3 ounces?) It also came with a side of rice, which hadn't been on the menu... I don't eat rice so left that aside.  Finally, my friend's sushi roll ($17 for the T.K. Bay:\nScallop, cucumber & tempura crunch topped with wasabi shrimp salad) came out, which she said was alright, but definitely smaller (8 pieces) and less filling than cheaper rolls at Red or Muramoto. \n\nI think there's a TON of potential for Tavernakaya, but I hope they figure out portioning/pricing /staffing soon.  Other friends who also saw fit to eat there in week one had better experiences ordering some of the more \"standby\" options like pork buns, dumplings, etc. It would be great to be able to enjoy the beautiful atmosphere and leave full and happy- I predict that once the kinks are worked out, I'll be there all the time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NRJ4iF8KIXKH2u_0nW2Brg"}

We decided to split some dishes. First we ordered the gyoza.  The pork dumplings were okay.  They had a lot of fluid in them which made them virtually impossible to eat with chopsticks. I dropped one of mine on the table but ate  it anyways.  Next we ordered the TKO sushi roll. It had bacon, pineapple, avocado and seared tuna. It didn't taste bad but with Muramoto around the corner you have to do better.  Next up was a pork belly skewer. Dry and boring.  Finally we got the Udon XO which was the best dish of the night.

Having been to their truck at First Friday and waiting over two hours for a burger, I no longer had to stand awkwardly in a crowd of hippies and deal with the ridiculous wait. \n\nATMOSPHERE\nSuper hip with loud ratchet music LOL Vibe resembled a lot like the atmosphere of First Friday. The artwork displayed here were definitely the highlight. Four LED displays above the counter featured their menu as well as some cool videos. \n\nSERVICE\nNot much to say about this department. I tipped them anyways and everyone yelled \"Tip Jelly!\" , then gave me a jelly. You also get to choose your funny nickname just like how it's done at the truck. Don't ask what mine was. \n\nFOOD\nThis is where I questioned myself whether to give three or four stars. I ordered the Buta Burger which is my usual order at Fukuburger. Juicy, mouth-watering beef patty with bacon, cheese, onions and red ginger. I did enjoy my burger. However, for a burger that is as small as my fist (and I have a small hand), its $7.99 price tag is not cute. \n\nI remember paying $5 at the truck and it was the same exact portion. Please do keep in mind, I have been to Bachi Burger and have no problem paying $12-26 for a burger because given the quality and portion, the price is justifiable. If you are going to charge $8, at least give bigger portion than the truck. Burger is good, just not worth $8 for such a tiny burger. \n\nIn addition, $2.10 for a small drink. Am I at Disneyland? \n\nCONCLUSION\nCome here for the atmosphere and amazing burger but prepare to pay around $10 and leave hungry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dh1zBLeeN61VEemOEkbYQQ"}

One of the perks to their new brick in mortar location (besides being convenient to me!) is that their food quality is consistent and their service has improved. The location also offers free wifi, as well as fun music and videos playing for entertainment while you wait.\n\nWhile their Buta Burger is still my favorite- always juicy, plenty of flavor!- the Naga dog is also a solid option. However, a flaw I've noticed with both is the bread. The burger buns are bulk-purchase and don't stand out, and tend to fall apart. I'd prefer a sturdier version (maybe an onion bun?), the King's Hawaiian buns would be a really great option, especially for the hotdog.\n\nI'm a little disappointed to see that the pricing is still a bit high- $8 for a burger is fair, adding $5 for a drink and fries is steep, and $9 for the (admittedly generously-sized) Naga dog is higher than several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs. I guess I expect slightly inflated pricing for food trucks, but to see the same prices here as at their Strip location was unexpected.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dh1zBLeeN61VEemOEkbYQQ"}

The sauces and spices that are infused in the burgers make for a very different burger experience, and in this case different is good. Crack sauce is great too, goes with everything. \nTheir portions aren't huge but it's definitely enough to hit the spot. However, Prices are a little high for the atmosphere and cuisine. A combo will run you $13.50 which are sit-down restaurant prices, so that may be enough to turn some people off. The location  is quite small as well so be prepared to push some tables together if you're in a group. \nAlso, come with a \"funny name\" to give them when you order your food--they'll ask you for one to call when your order is ready.

Filled with apprehension and wonder whether my journey would be successful, I drove the automobile to Findlay Lincoln, the same dealer that resurrected this car from the near dead three years ago when I absent-mindedly drove it over the cement curb of an unnoticed left turning lane in the wrong direction while on a detour, landing at an angle on the other side and bending two wheels and the struts supporting an axle.  Around $3,000 later, Humpty Dumpty was made whole again!  \n\nThis time I feared another major repair, but was pleased to hear, after a test drive and visual inspection by the service department, that only the front sway bar needed to be replaced.  The clunking noise was the result of instability caused by disintegrated front sway bar bushings.  No needed part was available in the Las Vegas valley, so the car had to stay overnight to be repaired after required parts arrived from other environs the next morning.  \n\nI was whisked off in a complimentary van, to be driven home by a man who I soon learned had been on stage as a regular member of Little Anthony and the Imperials, singing tenor and serving as the group's choreographer.  On a pleasant ride home my driver regaled me with true tales of Old Vegas and what it was like to play the lounge at Caesars Palace.\n\nUpon reaching home I just coincidentally retrieved from the mailbox a coupon that was good for $20 off any maintenance performed by the dealership.  It was fortuitous timing, and the next day I tendered the coupon to my friendly and helpful service advisor, Doug.  After deduction of Owner Advantage and all other eligible discounts, the price for repairs and an oil change dropped about $150 to just over $250 total.  As I drove the newly washed and once again tightly wound vehicle home in an ebullient mood, without hearing any more audible sounds of clunking, I reflected that the peace of mind and restored faith in the dependability of the car alone were well worth what I ultimately paid for the needed repairs.  I had truly received five-star service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ADa560YA2IG-IgeZdPI7SA"}

A HUGE thank you to Nate and the GM of BLT Steak Lawrence for a fantastic evening. The drinks, the food, the service and of course my fellow Yelpers all made for a dinner to remember. The theme of the evening was celebrating Sinatra's 100th birthday, and of course including Frank's favorite drink, Jack Daniels. \n\nAs we arrived we were escorted to our tables in the restaurant. BLT Steak is a classic LV steakhouse and proved to be one of the best. After checking in and receving our Yelp goodie bag we were served \"My Way\", a special Sinatra select Jack Daniels with a splash of water and an ice cube molded in to a copy of one of Frank's famous hats. The glass was a souvenir for us to keep which was a thoughtful gift.\n\nThe courses then began to appear, one after another in perfect timing. The courses were all paired with a Jack Daniels cocktail but if that wasn't your thing BLT also offered a wine pairing option which I chose. \n\nA quick review of the food:\n\nGruyere popovers. Enormous popovers with gruyere cheese, baked to perfection. Served with butter and sea salt. A great start!\n\nJack Daniels maple glazed bacon. Delicious, smoky bacon goodness. \n\nBrussel sprout salad. Presented beautifully. Although Im not a huge brussel sprout fan I enjoyed the dish. \n\nCrispy Red snapper with white beans. Loved this dish! Cooked perfectly with crispy skin but the fish was super moist. The beans and chorizo broth were a perfect match. \n\nJack Daniels Braised short ribs. Very tender and delicious. \n\nAll of the sides were enjoyed by our table as well. For the dessert a warm chocolate bread pudding with Jack Daniels Maple ice cream. Another winning combination. \n\nAlthough I did choose the wine pairing I really enjoyed the final Jack Daniels cocktail, \"Sweet Loraine\". It was a dessert cocktail with Jack Daniels, rumchata, maple & cinnamon syrup. Another perfect pairing with the bread pudding. \n\nThroughout the evening the service was flawless, the wait staff could not do enough for us.  The courses came out in perfect time along with your cocktail or wine and water was always refilled quickly. Our host Lawrence also described our food and drinks and told a few Sinatra stories. A perfect dining experience and YEE that I will not forget.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3Q8hiwfYYhQ_wcWsMrlbOw"}

Each course (5 total) was paired with a cocktail made from different Jack barrels/makes. To be completely honest, I'm not the biggest whiskey fan but I had a great time sampling all of BLT's cocktails! The highlights were probably the Sinatra Select with a fedora-etched ice cube and the spicy jalapeno/lemon cocktail!\n\nI've been talkin about the drinks, but the food deserves much attention as well. I uploaded a pic of our menu and to say it was extensive would be an understatement. I particularly enjoyed the maple glazed bacon (who knew bacon could get even BETTER), the braised short ribs and sides (hellllllo truffle mash) and the bread pudding and maple ice cream (although admittedly my dessert was a little more room temp than I would have liked). \n\nThere were also wine pairings available for all courses if you asked.

Nate also handed out a super cool Yelp Bag with awesome swags for the Elites.\n\nHubby and I were first to arrive and Lawrence welcomed us, and took us to the area where there were three long communal dining table and said to sit wherever we like.  Because the theme was \"Frank Sinatra's 100th Birthday,\" all the courses were paired with Jack Daniels cocktail, and even Lawrence were dressed Frank Sinatra-ish.\n\nThe courses consisted of:\nAmuse bouche - duck mousse with crostini.  This was a small bite that got me ready for the courses to come!\nGruyere popovers - served with butter and sea salt.  These were the biggest popovers I have seen to date.  It was made with gruyere cheese.  There was a recipe for this and I grabbed it.  I just have to find a popover pan to replicate these yummy popovers...or, just return for some more. \n\nJack Daniels Maple Glazed Bacon-Thick slices of heaven.  I am glad Lawrence had mentioned to save some of the popover to eat with this bacon.   \n\nBrussels Sprout Salad - a bit of sour, sweet, salty, nutty, and bitterness made this dish super refreshing, and my palate did not get bored.   It was beautifully plated. \n\nCrispy Red Snapper - Indeed crispy, served with braised white beans and chorizo broth. Fish was cooked perfectly!\n\nJack Daniels Braised Short Ribs - served with oyster mushroom, fried yams, truffle mash potatoes, creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and thumbelina carrots.  Everything was delicious, but the truffle mash potatoes deserve a call out.  The best mash potatoes I have had...better than Robuchon!  Now that's a bold statement, but is true, at least to me.\n\nWarm chocolate bread pudding with Jack Daniels Maple ice cream - Unfortunately I cannot eat the ice cream, but I did taste the chocolate bread pudding.  Decadent!  Once I have my baby, I am coming back to enjoy this dessert wholeheartedly.\n\nBefore dinner ended, the chef that made all the courses happened came out to speak to us.  That was super cool.  In addition, we each received a goodie bag, compliments of BLT (Jack Daniels glass and two very cool Frank Sinatra coasters).  \n\nA big thank you to Nate, our awesome CM, Lawrence, GM of BLT Steak, amazing chef, and the staff for making this night, one to remember!", "type": "review", "business_id": "3Q8hiwfYYhQ_wcWsMrlbOw"}

The first drink came in a souvenir glass with his drink of choice and was a great way to start the night. I appreciated Mr. Silva giving us some history about Mr. Sinatra with each drink being served. The cheers we were able to do really brought our table together and was a great way to interact.

Sit down dining experiences are just the absolute best!\n\nThis experience was designed all around Frank Sinatra's birthday, which was a pretty cool thing to do. The staff dressed the part. The cocktails all featured Frank's favorite: Jack Daniels. We all got a souvenir Sinatra glass to keep. And it was clear that a lot of thought and prep was put into the creation of the cocktails and pairing them with the dinner courses. It was great to hear from the mixologist about each cocktail. And each food item was also explained by staff to us.\n\nIt was a wonderfully thought out and planned event! A definite 5 stars for the event. The food and cocktails, though, were a bit underwhelming. James O. (my +1) and I have dined before at BLT Steak in Washington, DC. And it was absolutely amazing food (http://www.yelp.com/biz/blt-steak-washington)! Let's be real, the reason you come to BLT Steak is for the steak.\n\nThe popovers were delicious. The bacon was delicious. The red snapper was quite good. The mac 'n' cheese and truffle mashed potatoes were delicious (and honestly, probably my fav things). All the other food was ok - good enough to eat and prepared nicely, but not good enough to crave. \n\nThe \"Kings of Cool\" cocktail with jalapeno was my favorite. It was both tasty and unique. The \"Lingering Spirits\" cocktail with amaretto and cherry was decent. The other cocktails I didn't really want to finish. Now, to be fair, I think if these cocktails were made with a better whiskey (sorry Jack Daniels), I have little doubt I would've enjoyed them quite a bit. And again, they were paired nicely with the courses. \n\nThis was a great way to experience some of the other menu items, besides steak, that BLT Steak has to offer. And a great way to experience the new-ish Vegas location. But again, if you're coming to BLT Steak, I highly recommend you get a steak (the one I had in DC was seriously one of the best steaks I've ever had).", "type": "review", "business_id": "3Q8hiwfYYhQ_wcWsMrlbOw"}

The GM dressed like Frank and even read us a quote from Frank in his welcoming. The service was over the top. Drinks were always full, plates cleared quickly, and the servers were very friendly, even conversational. They definitely made us feel like guests in their home more than diners at a restaurant. \n\nThere was more than enough food and drink to go around. The quality and taste of the food was also over the top. The popovers to start the meal were huge. I loved the taste and texture which was definitely better than the average dinner roll. The Maple Glazed Bacon was my favorite food of the night. The smoky bacon with the sweet maple was delicious. I could eat just a plate of this as a course. The Brussel Sprout Salad was another unique dish that they really delivered on. The combination of brussel sprouts, hazelnuts, cranberries, blue cheese, and apple vinaigrette was delicious. I love when restaurants come up with unique twists on the usual and do it well. The Crispy Red Snapper was perfectly prepared with a perfect crispy crust. The chorizo broth with beans around the fish was delicious as well. The Braised Short Ribs was a great array of flavors. The short rib was tender, meaty, and flavorful. Everything on the plate was a perfect complement to the short rib. The mushroom, sweet potato dollop, and onion were full of flavorful. Last, but definitely not least was the Chocolate Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels Ice Cream. The bread pudding was tender and had a nice chocolate flavor without being too much. The ice cream was my favorite part of this dish.\n\nThe drinks were abundant and perfectly prepared. The bartender was right on point with the drinks. There was way too much alcohol to consume all of it, but I wish I could have because I loved them all. My favorite drink was the \"Lingering Spirits\" with Jack Daniels, amaretto, and cherry hazelnut bitters. I liked the slight sweet with the bold taste of the Jack Daniels. The most interesting drink of the night was the \"Kings of Cool\" which was largely jalapeno based. This was the hottest cocktail I've ever had, but it didn't overpower the flavor. I love spicy foods and this drink really satisfied the need for heat. The final drink, a sweet dessert cocktail was a nice finish to the meal. \n\nSince I'm new to Yelp it was nice to finally meet some other Yelpers in person. Everyone was warm and I enjoyed getting to know the few people I was able to meet. Hopefully next time I won't hit terrible traffic and I'll arrive early enough to mingle and meet others. :) \n\nIf Yelp events are usually half this good then I definitely want to attend more!

I submit that it cannot! \n\nBut before I even get into talking about the food or drinks, I want to give a huge shout out to the entire staff at BLT! This entire event from start to finish was just perfect in terms of service. Not only was GM Lawrence an incredibly nice guy with an obvious passion for this restaurant and Frank Sinatra, but every staff member was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. I particularly loved hearing the stories about the man himself, and getting details about nearly every course and drink really added to the experience. Getting to hear from the chef responsible for our meal at the end was just icing on the cake. \n\nNow with this being a sort of celebration of Sinatra, it's no surprise Jack Daniels was at the forefront of every course, especially when it came to the paired drinks. Thanks to some fellow Yelp pals, I'll admit I've leaned a little more to drinking straight bourbon over the last couple years, but I still enjoyed trying all the drinks at this event. Some were a bit too sweet for my taste, and the 'Kings of Cool' with jalape\u00f1o was definitely interesting...but my favorite had to be the 'My Way' which is just whiskey, a splash of water, and the coolest fedora imprinted ice cube I've ever seen. What made it even cooler is we got to take home the glass it was served in! \n\nThe JD theme continued on throughout the food as well. Our first course, Jack Daniels Maple Glazed Bacon, was one of my favorites from the night. Some of the best bacon I've had...with all the elements of smokiness, saltiness and a just touch of sweetness. I also really enjoyed the Jack Daniels Braised Short Ribs, and the sides accompanying were equally impressive. My most anticipated course from the night, believe it or not was dessert. The Jack Daniels Maple Ice Cream was absolutely delicious, and although the flavor of the bread pudding was great, our tables section all came out cold. Had the bread pudding been warm, I think it would have been an absolute home run. \n\nMy favorite dish from the night was the Crispy Red Snapper. The fish was incredibly tender, and the chorizo broth just brought everything together to make it the most flavorful plate of the night for me. It was probably about the only time I've been thankful the lady doesn't eat seafood, as it just left more for me. Other stand outs were the Brussel Sprout Salad and the pop over toast during the starter. I'm not sure if it's a good thing they put out the recipe for those things, cause I could probably eat an entire batch myself. The addition of a little cheese spread and some sea salt is incredible!\n\nIt's been a while since I've been to an event, but for me, this one was up there with the best. Cent'anni to Nate, Yelp, my lovely lady Lore D. for allowing me to be her +1, and the entire BLT crew for an unforgettable evening!

It looked like a royal feast was about to take flight.  And what a feast it was!\n\n1.) That duck mousse something in the little jar was my most favorite thing of the night.  I may have had three scoops of it...or four. \n2.) The maple glazed bacon was chewy and thick.  I am not a bacon lover like so many others, but I enjoyed this sweet treat.\n3.) The Brussels sprout salad was cruciferous and refreshing.  I liked the tangy dressing and the slight blue cheese flavor that wasn't too over powering.\n4.) The snapper I think was my favorite entree.  The crispy top was a nice texture.  The carrots and spinach that came with it were also very tasty.\n5.) The short rib was flavorful, but mine was a bit on the dry side.  And can we talk about the truffle mashed potato??  Holy moly, that stuff was good!\n6.) The bread pudding was dense and I couldn't finish it all, but the Jack Daniels ice cream was a very interesting flavor that I enjoyed.\n\nAs for the cocktails...well, I'm sad to say they weren't my favorite.  I love a good whiskey cocktail but could barely taste the whiskey in the drinks (save for the first one in the souvenier glass)! I felt like they were overpowered by the secondary ingredients, but at least I tried some new cocktails and ventured out.\n\nWhen the chef came out at the end, I was surprised by how young he was!

Shout out to Renzo for taking the lead on getting us reseated in the large, private dining room and to Phillip for handling the ordering for our table.\n\nOnce we got situated and ordered, conversation got flowing and the food started rolling out- surprisingly, the dumplings were not my favorite part of the meal, but rather the cumin lamb dish (bomb!) and the noodles! We had a great mix of dishes at our table, and an awesome mix of people in attendance- it was great to finally put a real face and personality to a few folks, and to catch up with friends.\n\nDumpling King was fairly good at helping us, though there was a bit of a language barrier with one of our servers (but perfection from the other!) and a delay to get our checks- but we were having a good time, so I don't think anyone really minded too much. Definitely looking forward to doing this again soon- follow up with Antonia for upcoming AYCE sushi plans!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lSSaiPJkf_NzCWswcRp9cg"}

Woooooooooo!!! \n\nThanks to the super reviewer Stefany V., I was able to partake in a wonderful gathering of fellow food lovers! I had already tried their cumin lamb and soup dumplings at my first visit, but carpe diem'ed on this opportunity to mingle in a more intimate, smaller group setting as well as stuff my face with a variety of foods.\n\nI gotta say, UYE is the way to go, since I've missed out meeting fellow yelpers at the larger elite events. I have \"friends\" in my list whom I had never met, but have been following for quite some time. And what's nice is that there's more flexibility for a plus one, so your significant others can also attend! \n\nSome of the highlights for food were: \n\nDimsum dumplings- LOVED the flavor of the inside. The skin was a bit poorly constructed, but it sure looked like a dumpling! \n\nBeef fried rice- gasp...didn't think it'd be great but it was surprisingly delicious and full of flavor. \n\nAnd of course the cumin lamb. It's packed with bold flavors, and the cumin definitely comes through. \n\nI shall pass on the crystal dumplings (kinda bland for my taste), crispy beef (which was overly salty with no other flavors), and the beef patty (which had a pungent oil smell that I couldn't really handle, and it was rather bland). \n\nThe juicy beef dumplings are a hit or miss. I've definitely had better at my fave Din Tai Fung spot in Cali, but this is still better than other places in Vegas. \n\nThey don't serve any pork here, hence their dumplings are all beef, as the owners are Muslim. But, me likes the beef so it's alllll gooooooood! \n\nLooking forward to more UYE's!!!!!!! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "lSSaiPJkf_NzCWswcRp9cg"}

I don't think I'd be going out on a limb here to say maybe one of the best events ever?  Some may say that might be a stretch when not being spoiled by lavish amounts of food and drinks, but experience wise, few events can compete.  There is something to be said about these smaller events in general in my opinion.\n\nThis place felt homey the second I walked in the door.  As soon as you walked in you saw an obvious husband and wife(Andrew and Liz) sitting behind the bar, grinning ear to ear, in this small little tasting room.  The place felt so much bigger though, when you looked through the window behind them and saw the full on operation.\n\nThe tour was great.  It was an in depth description of the process and science behind it, but without going over our heads with specifics.  I love their attention to detail.  That is hard to find in vodka's when you can just charcoal filter the hell out of em and get rid of all the funky tastes.  That said, I can't wait to try the bourbon and the gin as the tour talked about them as much as the vodka.  I get that about the tour though.  Vodka is a little bit more straight forward(minus the heads and tails aspect), while bourbon really gets in nuances from the barrel and gin from the spices.  Letting us smell the different possible aspects and flavor profiles of the gin was quite a treat, but the bourbon was already striking my curiosity by this point.  As soon as we started talking about the bourbon I was going to ask if there was a waiting list for the used barrels.  I should have known every brewer in town would want their hands on those things.  C'est la vie.\n\nOn to bottling.  We got to bottle our own booze!  I'm talking about filling the bottle.  Stamping and labeling the bottle.  Even getting to buy said bottle!(Yes, its sitting in my house right now).  That is a personal experience.  One I can now literally can say, been there, done that, even got the t-shirt.\n\nSo yeah, I enjoyed it to say the least.  Great crowd, nothing but good vibes, and how much more local can you get.  I know this local distillery movement hasn't taken off near as fast as the local brewery movement has, but these guys seem to have the knowledge and the vigor to make this work.

Being an engineer and craft lover, this hit my brain in all the right spots.  From the distillery tour and explanation of their farm to table (back to farm) process, this was hands down one of the most unique and fun experiences in my tenure as a yelper.\n\nI rode the light rail and totally mis-timed my arrival so I was the \"last to arrive\" (just put a big \"L\" on my forehead) but luckily I arrived in time for the tour to start.  Liz welcomed all of us with open arms and toured us through the tap room.  Though not a very large space, they have put a lot of thought and effort into every single element:  local salvaged barn wood, lighting created by Andrew, and a crafted tasting bar... So many stories behind each element.  I loved their story and nod to Andrew's grandfather and their inspiration of this distillery.\n\nAndrew took us through the entire process.  It was really interesting - especially since I've never been to a distillery before... Plenty of breweries, but this process was definitely new to me.  Being a chemical engineer, you can tell Andrew has a good grasp and working knowledge on what they are making here.\n\nThank you Liz and Andrew for hosting us and showing us your diggs!!!  Especially being able to bottle the product was super cool- I thought I was going to break something, but I ended up with a new bottle at home (and I got the tshirt... Mostly Kenny's fault).

In hindsight, I sort of regret that I didn't.

I use the word honor in the most literalist of senses. Seeing how passionate Andrew and Liz are about making good vodka in a local and sustainable fashion made the night so much then just a tour and tasting. I felt privileged to have had a glimpse into their lives and business. I would even go as far to say that last night may have been one of my favorite events this year. There is just something so special and amazing when you get to that grassroots level to really understand a business and the people behind it. \n\nLiz started the tour out with explaining the background and history of Doc Porters. I couldn't help but look around the room and notice how intentional every single decorative piece was. I mean, heck, the toilet paper roll in the bathroom was even designed like a pipe on purpose. Just from the start, I could tell this stemmed from a passion. We then went into the main production room. I learned so much about distilling. As someone who has been to many breweries, done many brewery tours, and has a home brewer as a husband,  I was looking for those similarities and differences in distilling. Didn't realize how much of an art form it was to get that perfect mix. Can't wait till 2017 to try some of that Bourbon!\n\nBottling the vodka was pretty cool. It was weird how easy it was to go from a plain old bottle to a cool looking product in a matter of minutes. We of course had to buy the bottle we filled and labeled ourselves!\n\nThe tasting was a nice little touch. You really can tell that the vodka is made from wheat (something unique about their vodka)! \n\nThanks Nikki for setting up such a fun event. Thanks to Andrew and Liz for giving us a fabulous evening to explore and understand your products. \n\nThis farm to bottle to farm distillery is going to be such a success in this city, due to the love put into it from Andrew and Liz.

We did ask if they could close it but as soon as they did another waitress would prop it open again. Now the food.....very good prices on apps and very good chips with guacamole. I had the three taco plate which was very good with shredded beef and husband had chicken tacos with rice and beans. He loved the tacos but not the rice and beans. Beans had a smokey flavor. We did feel the prices for the taco plates were a little high but all in all a good place, probably better when warm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FaymdoTfBSdPwg_ZfUE8zg"}

Thanks to Hailey, Erica and the folks at Yo Waffle for having us last night. Got some free gloves just for checking in. We came out from Scottsdale to try this place out and it was worth it. The hosts were incredibly welcoming and the owner personally greeted us and chatted with us as we waited in line. We were able to try the different flavors of froyo, gelato and sorbet as we indulged in the smell of freshly made waffles. My favorites were the Valencia orange and triple chocolate. My sweet tooth has lessened over the past year, so my food was quite decadent. I tried to balance it with fruit, which helped slightly. I do prefer savory foods, but obviously this is a froyo and waffle place, so there's only sweet items. \n\nI loved the atmosphere of the event: people dressed in their holiday sweaters (the joint one and the Barbie one were the best imo), the decorations and the weather were perfect. The outside had a photobooth, cup game (so creative) and even a froyo eating contest. We ended our night by playing Jenga, or tumbling towers. Overall, I enjoyed the night and it seems like this business will continue to do well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EZrKtxwuK19obexGC0dTzA"}

YoWAFFLE ever'day! \n\nFirst of, I would love to thank Trisha and her whole crew for letting us Phoenix Yelpers try Yo Waffle. Secondly, thank you to Hailey and her Yelp Crew for putting this Ugly Sweater Event eating yummy Froyo with Belgium Waffles! \n\nStarting off, I haven't been to a Yelp Event in a while because of schedule conflicts but I was glad to have made it to this one. It was great meeting lots of new joined Yelpers and Elites and also seeing Elites and Yelpers I have never met in person but on Yelp. \nWe started off trying flavors out, the YoWaffle team made it so nice to sample their froyos while waiting for the each Belgium Waffles to be made from Scratch. Trisha, the owner, said they have tiny little Belgium beads....I believe, don't quote me on that, but it is imported in and it really makes it extra special. They are unique in that aspect. \n\nI really liked the Vanilla custard, the Candy Cane, the Sea Salt and the Cookies and Cream Froyos. The Belgium waffle, as stated earlier has ingredients that makes it extra decadent and crispy. It is really yummy when it is fresh because it is warm and the froyo is cold. So that contrast makes it super yummy. Along with the 40 other toppings from your classic gummy bears/worms to your walnuts/peanuts. They even have mochi and Nutella! Mmmm. They had lots of fresh fruits and they all looked yummy, I wanted it all. \nI believe I saw on the board...a normal cup size is about $0.49/oz. Something like that, I didn't pay attention....but it was somewhere in the ballpark like that. \n\nThe games outside were super fun from \"being NAUGHTY or NICE\" prices; I was nice. I got some nice candies. :D My sister, Kellie, was nice, too; she got candy and a handheld charger...pretty nifty if you asked me. We wrote Christmas Cards to the troops...which is always nice. There was a game of Jenga. There was a cute little PhotoBooth...which is always nice! Last but not least, there were two games of Froyo eating contest. My sister, Kellie, was in the second contest...and to quote her, \"I can't feel my face.\" LOL. I believe Jackson won that round....along with the first round. Way the go, Jackson! I believe that was his first yelp event with his mom! \n\nWhat a night. It was so much FUN! Thank you YELP!\n\nAnyway, if you are craving waffles....craving froyo and in the Gilbert/Mesa area by Higley and Elliot...should drop by!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "EZrKtxwuK19obexGC0dTzA"}

The place is very contemporary, complete with WiFi, and enough tables & chairs if you opt to do any school work. One cool thing I found out is that the store design and props used are made of 100% recycled wooden pallets (the tables, benches, the back counter wall, etc...)\n\nService - It was their first day opening and I was informed it was a soft opening. Service was quick and pleasant. No complaints. \n\nProduct - I ordered the Honeydew Milk Tea with Boba. It was really good and refreshing. My main complaint about other boba places I've been to is that their drinks tend to feel grainy and powdery, which is a good indication that it's either old and powder based with very little liquid content. Did I mention they have macaroons as well ? I pigged out on 2 Nutella macaroons (I'm a sucker for anything Nutella) and it was the bomb.com \n\nFinal Thoughts - The place is brand spanking new.

What a time we live in.\n\nChewy Boba Company is a chain that originated in Florida. They just opened in Las Vegas last week, bringing a menu full of milk teas, non-milk teas, slushies, smoothies, specialty drinks (I forgot who asked me about oreo milk tea, but there's cookies and cream here), and frappes. Their add-ons include a huge variety of jellies and popping pearls. But what drew my eye is that they offer both mini boba and sea salt cream, each of which was previously only available at one Las Vegas location (to the best of my knowledge), and neither under the same roof... until now.\n\nI was very fortunate to stumble upon them today. I was having lunch right next door at Braddah's Island Style, which graciously had a few copies of the Chewy Boba to-go menu near their register. I also saw a Yelp tip about the buy one, get one 50% off soft opening deal (today was the last day, sorry guys), which the Chewy Boba employee in the front spontaneously told me about it when I walked up to the counter. I was actually contemplating that other boba chain on Maryland for teas and was pleased that I wouldn't have to experiment with their teas.\n\nWith no other customers in sight, I carefully browsed the menu and asked questions. Yes, they do offer ice and sweetness adjustments. No, they generally don't have fresh fruit except for avocado, banana, and something else that escapes my memory. And no, they didn't have mini boba, but yes, they could make it if I was willing to wait 20 minutes. Not a problem for me on this day. Phew!\n\nI tried some macarons while waiting for the mini boba. They're $2.25 each, or $12 for 6, or $23 for 12 if you dare. They're an \"authorized distributor\" of Macaron Cafe, which apparently is somewhat well-known in New York City. While I have no idea if they managed to keep the quality up while shipping the macarons across the country, I actually quite enjoyed my selections. The green tea macaron had surprisingly decent matcha flavor, and the pumpkin spice macaron lived up to expectations. Texture-wise, the \"cookies\" may be a little soft/wet, but I appreciated the soft, plentiful filling. Overall: great flavors, could use improvement in texture, and better than that place in the Galleria Mall.\n\nBack to the drinks, which is what's really important. I chose the large sea salt coffee without other add-ons ($3.75, plus $0.60 for large). Although I asked for less sweetness, this was still definitely on the sweet side of drinks, and the lighter side of coffee. Also, I think whatever salt is there is getting a little drowned out. But you know what? It still tastes yummy, bearing somewhat of a resemblance to my favorite local sea salt coffee, and I'm finding it hard to stop sipping.\n\nAlso hard to stop: my jasmine milk tea, less sweetness, no ice, with mini boba ($4.85 total since toppings are $0.50). Feel free to check my other reviews for the \"gospel of mini boba\" but I'm just gonna say that the freshly made mini boba is the best version of it that I've had. It's as al dente as the full size, and the flavor is good even though it's not honey boba. I did have some issues with it getting stuck in the normal-sized straw, but that seems to be a bit of an inherent risk. The jasmine flavor is relatively weak, and the sweetness was surprisingly low, so I would stick to full sweetness next time. But I still enjoyed the milkiness and the mini boba, so I slurped it almost all down before I got home.\n\nThey have a buy ten, get one (16 oz drink) free stamp card. It's clean so far, as expected of a new place, and they have about as much seating as you'll usually find in a good bubble tea shop. Also, their to-go menu states that they have the ideal customer satisfaction policy: they will adjust or remake your drink to your liking. I didn't feel like testing them over relatively small issues, one of which I could have avoided entirely. Besides, the quantity of ice in the coffee was actually quite modest.\n\nThis isn't the best boba in town, but maybe it's the second best. I'll definitely make excuses to return to Chewy Boba Company sooner than later. They're closer to my side of town than most spots, and they should do really well because they're right across from UNLV and are reasonably priced.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNBzT2p1VPl3LizoWsJLmg"}

They were able to help me decide which drink to get. \n\nDRINK\nMy usual drink to test any boba shop is regular milk tea or jasmine milk tea but after talking to the friendly people here, I somehow ended up with a large honey milk tea with sea salt cream and boba. It came out to be $5.24 for their 24oz. \n\nI'm usually not a fan of sea salt cream because it is a lot milkier than just a regular milk tea but sea salt cream here wasn't too thick or overwhelming. Drink itself was really sweet for my liking so I would order this less sweet next time. 4/5\n\nBoba here has al dente texture and is marinated in longan honey and brown sugar. Sadly I didn't taste any honey or brown sugar since my drink was honey milk tea but I enjoyed the texture of it. They also have mini boba which is rare to find in Vegas boba scene (as far as I know Tapioca Express is the only other place to have it). \n\nCONCLUSION\nGood vibe, good drink, good boba.

Horne Hyundai could change all that but alas, it would seem that the service representatives are on some kind of commission structure and $600 is the goal management wants to get from every non-warranty service appointment. You get a very reasonable oil change - tire rotation and inspection coupon via email. The inspection will remarkably turn up a collection of service issues that just happen to cost somewhere around $625 - $725. \nThe fluids inspection is a really good idea, but they should explain the process and ask the car owner to watch as they check the fluids. So far they haven't given me any feedback about how long the service is going to take, so you wait and wait and wait.  No status reports, no updates and no way to change the TV channel or turn the volume down. I have suggested twice that since they have a TV, I wish they would give me a channel I could switch to and see the work being done on my car. That will never happen I guess because you might be able to see that there must be long periods of time that nothing is being done on your car.  Why else would it take 3 hours to do an oil change and tire rotation? You should always ask to see YOUR old parts (especially cabin filters, fuses and such...), watch any inspections that they will let you watch and go on test drives to explain how or when that noise, shimmy or what ever shows up. Tires are now rotated front to rear so you should black magic marker your front tires with a \"F\" to make sure they are rotated correctly. You would think that a $600 - $700 service charge would automatically be worth a free car wash. Although it was getting close to closing time, for the first time today I was offered a free car wash.

One guy said that they would not have silver as it came from the factory. I said I don't care if it is purple, please put one on. Unfortunately, we drove all the way back from Gilbert to Maricopa before I thought to check, and then I found that it was still missing. \n\nOn Saturday I wrote the Horne Hyundai service department, by mistake, and within minutes I had a call from their service department. I explained that I had made a mistake and had written a second time to apologize. The guy said he would send me a valve stem cover which I said was unnecessary because it was not their problem. Then I got an email apologizing for their poor service and finally a third email saying a full set of valve stem covers was being shipped and I should have them by Tuesday.\n\nWOW and double WOW.

I have not been to see the Nutcracker in many years so I was very excited to see it. I didn't realize how many connections the Nutcracker had with Pittsburgh until o read about it in the program. Before they ballet opened they brought Sally Wiggan, a local newscaster, and shared that she was going to be one of the guests at the party in the Nutcracker. She stated she had the opportunity to \"attend the party\" several times and really enjoyed it. Again they were bringing a bit of Pittsburgh into the ballet.\nFrom the moment the curtained opened until the final curtain I was mesmerized. Everything was literally on pointe. I loved how they incorporated some of today's dance moves into the ballet by in the first act the young man did a few. Whip and Nae Nae moves. It was funny to see who in the audience knew what he was doing. Later in the performance a young man did the Cabbage Patch and the Sprinkler. Again, it was funny to see who responded. \nI think most little girls would want to play the part of Marie or the Sugar Plum Fairy but the dancer who drew my eye was the young woman who was the Arabian dancer. She was flawless, graceful, and to me was the best ballerina of the show.  She made everything she did look effortless. \nOf course seeing the tiny dancers is heartwarming. They are all just adorable. In one part of the show the little ones were building a human pyramid and one of the tots who was supposed to be on top just couldn't make it. It didn't mess up the performance, it actually made it more enchanting. Of course my very favorite was at the end when the bees turned their backs to us and wiggled their behinds. \nI don't know if many little girls dream about becoming a ballerina in today's world where they can dream about one of the many options they have but I dreamed of being a ballerina when I was little.

I wish that I could say the show lived up to my expectations, but to be perfectly honest, it did not. For me, the bright spots of the performance were the Snow King and Snow Queen, the Arabian dancers, and the fun Pittsburgh references, such as the large clock and the party guests. I struggled with the pace of the show as it began to feel long to me, especially in Act I, and also with the very softly projected pre-recorded music. Maybe the music was louder closer to the stage, but from row R on the main floor, I could more easily hear a number of whispered conversations and show commentary occurring around me than I could hear the actual music.\n\nI love attending plays and musicals but must admit that I would have been disappointed to have paid $50/seat to attend this show.

It's a place where you could sit down with a couple of friends, grab a beer and chill. Or you could get some scooby snax to go. \n\nWe got the 5 spice, the Korean and the crispy pork belly baos as well as the kimchi bulgogi fries. Overall, the fries definitely stood out to us the most in terms of flavour and portion for the cost. It was $4, and $2 extra for bulgogi added. Our favourite was the Korean bao! From what we remember it had bulgogi, scallions, cucumber, kimchi. \n\nWe both agreed that if this was THE place to bring our family or friends when they visit in the future. We were both extremely satisfied with the experience. It was so refreshing to see a high-quality, quaint restaurant pop up in an area away from the shawarma and Chinese food crowd. \n\n- M.

Friendly staff welcomed us and hooked us up with food and drinks, the nameless cranberry-gin-rosemary-St. Germain concoction being my favorite. The beef carpaccio was almost too beautifully plated to eat, but it disappeared across the table in record time. I'm definitely planning to swing by again for brunch or happy hour.\n\nThe whiskey portion of the event allowed attendees to hear the history and differences between whiskey, bourbon, and scotch. It was cool to progressively challenge our palates with spicier sips (Bullet) and then return to the original (Buffalo Trace), finding it sweeter and more pleasingly aromatic. Tater was a knowledgeable teacher, and great about putting alcohol terminology into basic terms and making comparisons we could understand. I am only bummed that we were unable to meet in the Oak & Ivy proper, which remains a dark mystery- but the relocation was necessitated by the cold, and much appreciated by the desert rats.\n\nBut we all know the people are what make the event! From Tater to Chef Marvin, the various bartenders and serving staff, and our own Nate M., everyone involved with event organization was pleasant and personable. Yelpers present included a mix of familiar faces (Lisa, Niyen, Mr & Mrs Q), some new Elites (Kevin!),  a new Vegas transplant (Sarah S!), and even a Canadian Elite popping in while on vacation.

It was a gin/fizz/egg white/rosemary cocktail - I know that doesn't sound like a great combo but it truly was tasty and refreshing.

That was really helpful considering the Las Vegas Christmas winds.  brr...\n\nOur group was set up with The Perch offerings first.   My pictures should speak for themselves, but there were two plates and two cocktails.   The beef carpaccio was delicious as was the shrimp pasta.   The cocktails were great... the first was a cranberry gin, which as a gin person I thought that it was a little light on the gin side, but very refreshing.  A good starter.  The other cocktail was an eggnog drink as a seasonal which is rumchatta, bourbon and heavy cream.  RIDICULOUS.   This is an off menu item, but wow.   Crazy good.  They need to think about adding that to the drink menu.\n\nThe whiskey tasting was interesting to say the least.  Having gone through wine tasting before, I was expecting to spit, but.... why when it was only a little bit?\n\nWe tasted Buffalo Trace, Redemption and Bulleit which went from bourbon to a rye based.   Very educational and the guys at Oak & Ivy really know their stuff.  Taught you how to try smell the different aromas and how they interacted.  Very fun.\n\nIn usual fashion, we did an after-party for YEE at Oak & Ivy.

We were supposed to switch locations with our groups, but since it was RIDICULOUSLY cold outside, we stayed inside the Toasty warm Perch, and just switched tables.  Way to look out for us guys!!\n\nI was in the \"diamonds\" group, so I started with The Perch offerings first.  \nWe sampled a delightful gin cocktail:  Cranberry Juice, St. Germaine, Gin, and apparently a touch of egg white to make it nice and frothy, garnished with rosemary.  I'm not a gin drinker, but I could have had these all night!  Really tasty.  \n\nAfter this drink, we tried the Beef Carpaccio, which was really beautifully plated:  Thinly sliced raw beef, with shaved parmigiano, and a balsamic glaze over micro arugula. \nI'm a big fan of Carpaccio anyway.  I didn't want to start eating it at first, because it was too pretty.  I'm glad I dove in though, because it was really delicious.  \n\nNext, we tried the Spicy Shrimp Pasta (which I think I mislabled on Instagram last night.  OOOPS!  I'll have to fix that.)  Shrimp cooked to perfection, served with an aldente pasta and cherry tomatoes in a Sriracha cream sauce: THIS was delightful.  I'd go back just for this dish.  In fact, I can't wait to take my husband to The Perch to try out the regular sized portion!!!\n\nAfter the delicious food, we were given another cocktail:  An Eggnog Boilermaker type drink...I was a little wary about this one, but after having one...I'll take a dozen!\nBasically, this was Rumchata (YUM) and heavy cream with an eggshell in the drink with a shot of bourbon inside the eggshell.  You pushed the egg down into the drink to mix, and then had the option to either sip or \"chug\" through the straw.  I, of course, chugged.  What a tasty little drink!  I'd definitely enjoy another one of these, any day of the week.  \n\nAfter The Perch's offerings, we switched tables for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance:  The Whiskey tasting.  \nI love me some good whiskey. Although I'm more of a fan of Scottish Whiskey (Scotch), I do enjoy a good American Whiskey from time to time, and its been a long while since I've had a good one.  \nChris, or Tater, from Oak & Ivy, really knows his stuff. He gave us a rundown of what makes Whiskey Whiskey, and the differences between bourbon and rye.  He showed us the proper way to sip (and \"the chew\" which I was familiar with from my Scotch drinking)...My favorite was the super spicy rye.  \n\nAll in all, it was a great night. \nThere was a good mix of old faces, and new.  I loved having the chance to chat with so many great people.\n\nThanks to The Perch, Oak & Ivy, and Nate for a stellar end to 2015.  *raises glass of Rye* May next year bring even more adventures!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IitTBIY8DiJwhxPXL3x80A"}

It succeeded in getting me back to Downtown Container Park--somewhere I hadn't visited in a very long time. It also succeeded in introducing me to a couple of neat businesses I never knew existed.\n\nI use the term \"neat\" not by coincidence. I enjoyed sampling the three whiskeys in official neat tasting glasses. The exaggerated tulip shape of the glass is perfect for enhancing the aromas of the whiskey while suppressing the alcohol burn. It definitely allowed me to appreciate the bouquet, to borrow a wine term, but I'm not sure the shape is ideal for actual drinking. (That doesn't mean I'm not buying a couple stat).\n\nIn any case, the head-bartender-mixologist-whiskey-aficionado dude (forgot his name) was a fantastic guide. His passion for American whiskey was evident and I am definitely coming back soon to check out Oak & Ivy. Due to the cold weather, the entirety of the event actually took place inside The Perch and that was our group's second \"stop.\" By the way, apologies to the other group that we ate all of the JinJu Chocolates.

Still, I learned more than I ever had about how to enjoy and taste whiskey/scotch/bourbon than I ever have before so now I'll know for when I try it elsewhere.\n\nAs for the food, I enjoyed the carpaccio but I did feel like there was a bit too much balsamic on it which covered up the taste of the beef. The shrimp pasta was also reasonably tasty but lacked salt on a significant level. Whether or not this is because of a bit of mass production or not, I still enjoyed the flavors they were trying to put forth. As for the cocktails, I thought both were excellent and very enjoyable with uniqueness in both of them.\n\nWe got a bit of yelp swag, including a cool little set of finger-less gloves, one of the few articles I still hadn't received up to that point.\n\nThanks to Nate, as he did a great job organizing this event as juggling between two different tables was easier than expected.

Container Park was decorated with Christmas lights and it was wonderful to walk through and see it all. We went straight to the Perch and to our surprise, the whole event was moved indoors. That was music to my ears! \n\nOur first table was the whiskey table where we got to try three different types of American whiskey, learn about them, the differences, and then stuffed our faces with some chocolates from Jinju. Now, I'm not a whiskey drinker so I can't say that I LOVED it a lot but I do appreciate learning about them, which is why I wanted to come in the first place. We got to try a sweet, spicy, and bitter whiskey. The chocolates from Jinju was definitely our saving grace from the bitterness we taste from the whiskey.\n\nThen afterwards, we got to switch tables! Swappity swap! We got to experience the food table! Here, we got to try two drinks and two dishes from the Perch. We had a cranberry-gin-rosemary concoction as our first drink and it was light and refreshing compared to the whiskey. We got to try their beef carpaccio, which was very nice. I liked the arugula and the balsamic but the balsamic was a little on the heavy side -- it made it hard to be able to taste the beef for what it is. The second drink we got to try was a bourbon eggnog. It was very yummy but a little too strong for my taste buds and it was the first time I had any form of eggnog! The second dish we got to try was their spicy shrimp pasta. The pasta was well put together but the seasoning is a little off. It was almost bland to my taste buds. \n\nWe got treated to some Yelp swag! Fingerless gloves and a candy cane for the holidays!

Partially from the Yelp love, and our super involved CM Nate. But also the fellow Elite company, and the whiskey! How liquor went from harsh and strong, to tasting like creme brulee, still excites me. \nWe all showed up VERY bundled up ready to freeze our butts off, however some strings were pulled and we got a couple of tables inside the Perch. One section was Oak & Ivy, and one section was The Perch. Regardless of which table you started at, you were greeted with alcohol. \nI first started at The Perch table where we sampled beef carpaccio and spicy shrimp pasta.  I am not a raw meat person, but I was one of the only people at the table with beef still left on their plate. Which tells me it was a good version of the dish. I of course tried it, and it was decent. But I don't have anything to compare it to, so I am not a fair judgement of what was served. Now the pasta, I know what that is supposed to taste like and it sure hit the spot. \nWhen the chef brought it out, he explained there was a little sriracha added to the cream sauce for spice. It was light, I personally could have taken more spice. However the overall flavor of the dish was excellent. I would order this in a heartbeat! I was also very impressed with the service of the staff at the Perch. They did great catering to us needy Yelpers. \nNext we did a switch. I am happy I got the table with the food first once I seen the whiskey that Oak & Ivy was pouring us. Oh man, this was not a simple tasting! These were nice 3 oz pours, oh and did I mention THREE OF THEM! We had an amazing mixologist who truly knew his stuff, and had a passion for liquor, how it was made, the flavor, and how to enjoy it. I could have listened to him talk for hours. I really loved how educated he was on the craft.  I will personally be taking a trip to Oak and Ivy to pick his brain about Vodka. Yes, Oak & Ivy is a whiskey bar. But they have a full bar of their favorite liquors for people like me. \nOverall, what a way to end the Yelp Elite Year!

In that vein, what a welcome this was! \n\nService was inviting and super courteous, the food attractive in its preparation, and the whole spread was diverse and flavorful. I RSVP'd for that awesome eggnog concoction and whiskey tasting, but everything impressed. In fact, even the Yelp fingerless glove holiday gift has been worn on several occasions already, including when I work from home with the heat off to save on that electric bill so I can have a little extra play money.

Like ordering \"red wine,\" but not distinguishing which type or from what vineyard. Ever had a muscadine red from NC? Having learned the hard way, it is not the same as European or even Californian reds. \nHow can one know the flavor comparisons without a legit tasting and an expert at the helm guiding you through? One cannot. Aces to Tater. \n\nI left this event fat, happy, educated, and with new friendly connections. That's a success. Thank you, Nate, for rounding out an excellent Yelp year.

It is trendy, but not overly pretentious.\n\nAt the corner of the bar, there was a mountain of ice and a big selection of oysters. At the time I was there - 2 different West Coast species, and 4 different East Coast. I loved all but one of the East Coast. I do quite like oysters, but unfortunately am not enough of an expert to give an expert review. I'll just say that they were some of the best I've ever had.\n\nAs for drinks, there was a nice little cocktail selection, including a couple New Orleans classics like the French 75 and the Sazerac. I thought the champagne of the French 75 paired nicely with the oysters.\n\nI'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the food from the kitchen! The po-boy looks especially exciting, and can also be made vegetarian. \n\nIts always nice to be able to have a place to drop in and have a half-dozen oysters when I'm not super hungry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7GTl6b4TwEzkbUkq0C8b4w"}

The good news is the oysters were varied and fresh. I particularly liked the West Coast offering but that's a preference for Pacific salt. Our dining companion had an assortment of the East Coast choices and reported them to very good as well (although I seldom see so much horseradish scooped on a half shell). We also ordered the chargrilled oysters ... OK unless you've actually been to the Acme in NO. Other starters were predictable but the head-on shrimp were generous in size, quantity and quality. \n\nNow the bad news. Staff is friendly enough but still undertrained ... e.g., wasn't sure about wine and bourbon offerings or source of oysters. Drink pours are precise, stingy, and a bit pricey.\n\nMost problematic: our chicken entree came out dangerously undercooked (bloody at the bone) and, while they dropped from tab, staff \"rationalized\" in uncomfortable ways.\n\nGroup consensus: we'll give Muddy Waters another chance in a month or so ... cherry-picking menu options ... and hoping kitchen and wait staff are a bit more prepared.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7GTl6b4TwEzkbUkq0C8b4w"}

But my 2 experiences at Blue 32 were so weird that I feel compelled to remark.  \n\nLast week we visited and sat outside about an hour before sunset.  As far away from the center of the restaurant as possible it was quite relaxing.  Apparently a couple of smokers thought so too, standing within 3 feet of our table as smoke logically drifted our direction.  Staff noticed but ignored them...weird.  \n\nI ordered pulled pork with coleslaw and cowboy beans.  The menu must have said \"or\" cowboy beans because they weren't on the curiously-sparse plate.  Service was a little slow, but very friendly, and the food was delicious.  We returned a few days later & I noticed the menu actually did say \"and\" vs. \"or\".  What happened to my cowboy beans?  That felt...weird.\n\nOn that same trip she ordered fish tacos.  The portion was a bit small (2 tacos), but also delicious.  Fish tacos are a favorite no matter where we eat so I wasn't surprised that she ordered them on the return trip.  And she LOVED the fries.  This time there were 3 tacos on the plate...weird.\n\nThe second visit was inside, smack in the middle of a vast array of silent TVs on various sport channels, mostly washed up jocks talking statistics that you had to lip read.  At least, thanks to acoustics, the patrons and food service sounds were very loud.  So if you go out with someone that you really don't want to talk to, this is the place for you.  You can sit and watch TV over her shoulder while she watches over yours. But for me, that was just...weird.\n\nAlthough we were close to the bar, the drinks were very slow coming.  I ordered the rib & wing sampler this time.  I'll have to order Hot wings next time because the Medium tasted pretty Mild.  The ribs were very dry, and had only the faintest hint of barbecue sauce.  I like mine juicy and saucy.  Uh, excuse me... I'm talking about baby back ribs here!  I know... I'm weird.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T-LhjPRqlS7hLGRmSMBbfA"}

We knew there was a Blue 32 somewhere in this area and I then started thinking about their baked potato soup.  Oh yeah!   That's what I want.\n\nThis is a nice newer location tucked back off Higley in a strip mall, and right away we were greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth along the side wall.  TVs everywhere!  It was easy to keep up with whatever sports action was going on at the time.  On that note, can we just get to baseball season...please!\n\nWe started with the calamari app and I had a pint of Papago Orange Blossom Ale and he had a pint of Sam Adams winter lager.  Both are beers we are well familiar with and they went well with the calamari.  The calamari were fried nice and light with a good dipping sauce on the side, but the breading had way too much black pepper for our taste.  Smart on their part because that will make people drink more beer.  We ate it, but I would not order it again.\n\nThen came my bowl of baked potato soup which was just as good as I remember from having it at the other Gilbert location.  I aspire to make soup this good.  \n\nMr. M tried the pastrami sliders and those were really delicious!  Flavorful, tender pastrami, melty cheese, fresh pickles, toasted buns, AND you get 4 instead of 3 like most places.  Now we have a couple of new addictions at Blue 32.  The soup, those sliders, and orange blossom ale.  Could it get any better?  Yum!  \n\nWith the food I mentioned plus another pint of orange blossom ale to share, the total was $37.77 before tax and tip.  Lexi was our server and she took great care of us.

I made my way here on a Monday evening just after their grand opening.  The hotel is adorable, the designers stayed true to the original architecture and charm of the original YMCA that was housed here, and the Whitfield sits just inside the main doors to your left.  \n\nOur waitress, Angel, was a real angel and a total delight to engage with throughout the entire dining experience.  Lee and I ordered the semolina gnocchi as our appetizer: made with soft gnocchi, rabbit, beans, and braised olives.\n\nFor our entrees, Lee ordered The Steak, which is the chef's choice of cut for that day and on this particular day it was a sirloin.  The Steak is served with fries and a bearnaise sauce and was excellent all around.  I would highly recommend the bearnaise when choosing any of their beef options on the menu that have been carefully selected by the chef.\n\nI ordered the smoked chicken and was not disappointed in the least. The portion sizes for all of our dishes were excellent, and my dish was no exception.  A large, smoked chicken breast with perfectly crispy skin, served over gravy and dumplings... so good! It's an upscale take on a good old fashioned, stick to your ribs chicken and dumplings that you'd get at your mom's house.   We also opted to share the bacon mac and cheese and holy Lordy was it good.  I think I might just order that as my meal next time!  The cheese sauce was the perfect consistency, and the panko and bacon topping was just crunchy enough.  We finished off our meal with a slice of the olive oil chocolate cake.\n\nAll around it was a wonderful experience. I'm so excited to have the Ace Hotel here in Pittsburgh and will absolutely be back to the Whitfield many times.  It's obvious that the staff, from the front of the house to the back, knows exactly what they're doing and I look forward to them keeping up this amazing, delicious work!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BdckEea0axlkaqGr4Bh7IA"}

The goal is to ensure each child gets 3 presents on Christmas morning. Irrespective of a child's family's financial situation, EVERY child deserves to smile on Christmas.

They had down a clam chowder which would be nice on these cooler...for Arizona days and a pear and cranberry salad we almost got which looks to be a seasonal salad?  Noticed they did have a kid's menu which is probably a tougher sell for kids today, but the 4 or so choices I saw on their site did have a variety between them to hopefully find something they will like.\n\nOverall for our first visit the service was fast, the food was good, nice salad selections and the price was very reasonable compared to the other less healthy choices around here.  Look forward to trying some of their other items and maybe a wrap to see if I can eat a salad in the car:)", "type": "review", "business_id": "rtqtZ0_kOA-GP33mn6-Kpg"}

They are part of the same restaurant group as Doh Sushi, Tofu Hut, and J Karaoke on Spring Mountain Rd. They are also located in the popular shopping complex that houses gelato shop Gelotology, coffee place Seranade, and the Rice n Noods. These guys are doing a solid job and it's a welcome addition to this neighborhood.\n\nThey have a couple of different menus; lunch, dinner 1, and dinner 2. Lunch is available until 3pm, Dinner 1 includes everything for lunch plus short ribs, and Dinner 2 includes everything for Dinner 1 plus rib eye. I chose lunch this time, but I would like to come again to try the dinners.\n\nWhat I noticed first, Doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to, a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable, rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise. After ordering, the food quickly started rolling out.\n\nThe banchan was good, and their kimchi is very good, aged correctly. The steamed egg came out, and it was good as well, nice and fluffy, without being watery. \n\nMy meats then started coming out. The brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue. I thought their bulgogi is good, not at the Gen level, but good nonetheless.\n\nThe service was excellent, with my server asking if I needed anything, and asking if everything is good, which it was.\n\nWhile Tofu Hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years, I'm glad to report that Doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves. Oh yea, one more thing...\n\nFtr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr \n\nDoh!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cjJvvEbpo9b_76hV_lyFXg"}

The fried rice actually had vegetables in it, kicking the trend of most other Asian restaurants that just throw some soy sauce on and call it fried rice. The chicken was coated with a light and crispy coating and a tasty sauce that could have been a tad spicier, but as they are new and don't want to scald new customers tastebuds, it was a small oversight.

Then for the more adventurous snackers, you can pick up some chocolate covered insects or some Bacon & Cheddar flavored crickets...for real. \n\nThe employees are very helpful, they will let you sample any of the jerky they offer, each employee has a set of snips holstered on their belt and they will cut you a piece of whatever you want to try from a bag stashed in a little barrel just below the displayed packages hanging on the wall. \n\nThis is their newer location just a short distance from where the old store was.

The menu is simple yet tasty, with your choice of cheese, steak or shrimp fondue, and the most amazing fries! Included with your entire is unlimited wine, red or white served in...baby bottles !!! So this sounds a little strange, and at first I was hesitant but it was a really neat experience. This concept was based on the history of the original restaurant in Paris and had something to do with the liquor tax in France. The staff were attentive, knowledgable and gave outstanding service. I would certainly come here again, this time I would try the shrimp fondue and leave room for the chocolate fondue for desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jt483eMod3OR36S3KMN4gg"}

Pigalle was open, and it did not disappoint!  First of all, the decor transports you straight to a brothel in the Montmatre district in Paris.  I loved the graffiti art all over the walls, including in the bathrooms and the outdoor lounge area.  Everywhere you look, you're seeing a new detail.  \n\nThe food was excellent.  We ordered the steak fondue (with the intention of returning to try the cheese fondue next time, of course) and french fries.  The waiter gave us instructions on how long to cook the steak in the heated oil they placed on our table.  The steak also came with delicious cooked kale and potatoes on the side.  It also came with four delicious dipping sauces that I won't be able to do justice by describing them here.  You'll just have to go there to try them.  They also serve wine in baby bottles.  This does not seem weird at all after your second swig of delicious wine.  Make sure to ask your server the story behind the bottles.\n\nThere also was a full bar of handsome bearded bartenders in the backyard/outdoor lounge area.  Okay, I don't exactly remember if they all were bearded, but they certainly were handsome and knowledgeable.  Most importantly, they poured excellent, carefully crafted drinks.  The hospitality all around (waiter, front of house guy, bartenders) was on par with what you'd find at any world class restaurant.  \n\nWe really enjoyed this place.  I intend to return with friends soon and highly recommend that you do too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jt483eMod3OR36S3KMN4gg"}

They fried up one kind of cake style donut and as you wait in line. They provide check off menu sheets with pens that differ from the choices of the menu board posted on the wall that leave you confused and unsure what to order when you make it up in line to the cashier.\n\nI decided to try a blackberry crumb donut. I don't know what kind of donut I got was but I can tell you the main flavor was old grease topped with something they call glaze that taste like weird flavored pancake syrup that is sticky. The donut was also an odd shape and if it had a handle you could spin it like a top. My donut was greasy and was a crunchy sponge for grease soaked with weird sticky syrup topping.\n\nHonestly this was the worst tasting donut I ever had in my life. Even donuts from cheap Chinese buffets taste better and are usually fluffy. Donuts from super markets aren't the best but they taste better too with a sweet glaze or frosting. I know Fractured Prune Doughnuts is a chain but I thought if they only made one flavor as the base donut they'd make a good one.\n\nIt's a possibility that I hit them when they were extra busy and didn't have time to change the oil. It's a busy pre-holiday weekend and also the opening week of the Star Wars Movie.  I just can't defend their glaze, that truly was awful tasting.\n\nThey offer inside and some outdoor seating. You can also do take out if you care too.\n\nYou might want to give Fractured Prune Doughnuts a spin but I won't so that's a one star to me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iYk5QEI3IZmr25L3QWz4KQ"}

I'll admit that when I came across Fractured Prune Doughnuts, the only thing mildly appealing about their name was the word \"doughnuts.\" Prune donuts? No. Luckily their odd name has nothing to do with the shriveled up plums typically reserved for those trying to stay \"regular.\" The shop is purportedly named after a local 1800's athlete named Prunella, whose brittle bones earned her the nickname \"Fractured Prune.\" Not sure if it's the best name for a donut shop but anyway....History lesson over - let's move on to the treats!\n\nNow I recognize that there are a lot of boutique-style donut shops all over the country. Not unlike the cupcake craze, these eateries try to wow consumers with a dizzying array of decadent and unusual toppings. Fractured Prune is no different. They have everything from Marshmallow Madness (marshmallow glaze topped with marshmallows) to the seemingly now ubiquitous Bacon Bomb (bacon and cinnamon - is this bacon fad ever going to end??). Unlike many donut places that offer different types of base doughs (cake, raised, chocolate, pumpkin spice, etc.), Fractured Prune only offers one - a basic cake donut. Like Krispy Kreme, they take the base donuts and simply dip them into different glazes and add toppings. The good news is that when that inner tube of cake dough reaches it's destination after floating down the hot grease river (yes, like KK you can watch the entire journey!) the result is decadent and delicious. Also, unlike other shops where they make all the donuts and display them in the window, they won't dip your donuts until you order them, so they are guaranteed fresh.\n\nYou order by using a handy paper slip, describing each of their creations. You can also flip the script and make your own. I opted for the Salted Caramel and the Ms. Prunella.\n\nThe Salted Caramel is exactly what you would expect. The aforementioned cake donut, dipped in a caramel glaze and topped with sea salt. It came in a tray and it looked like a hot mess, so I went Seinfeld and attacked it with a fork and knife. The cake itself was heavenly - piping hot with the perfect texture. It was a bit on the greasy side, which I suppose is to be expected. The caramel glaze was a little runnier that I would've liked but still nice and sweet. Unfortunately it seemed like all the flavors were completed overshadowed by the salt. It was very salty. I am a sucker for salted caramel treats and I like that hint of saltiness to balance out what is typically an over-sweet dessert, but in this case, it was just too much.\n\nWater-break (they have a water cooler tucked away in the back corner! Great palate-cleanser)\n\nNext: On to Ms. Prunella. I supposed that this would be the closest thing to their \"signature\" donut and that is why I ordered it. It starts again with the basic cake donut, this time dipped in a mixed berry glaze and topped with cinnamon sugar. This one was much more palatable - the sweet/tart of the mixed berry glaze hit the spot! This is one I would order again.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed trying out Fractured Prune. It was a nice treat on a relatively cool day. If you do decide to try them out, I would recommend that you eat them right away so you can properly enjoy that hot dough. At $2 a pop, they aren't necessarily cheap, but they aren't even close to some of the ridiculous prices you see people paying for those fancy cupcakes.\n\nEnjoy!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iYk5QEI3IZmr25L3QWz4KQ"}

We live across the street at Optima so we've been anxiously awaiting this new theater to open. We were disappointed to learn this is not a \"full service\" theater like Ipic or AMC Esplanade. It's kind of a hybrid service model - yes they serve alcohol and a limited menu, but you need to buy the food/drinks and carry them to your seat with you. \n\nSo we expected a busy opening night, got there early and went to the bar. There was a huge line to get food items so we asked the bartender if we could order at the bar which we did. He then told us we had to get in that giant line to pick up our food when our name was called. This turned into a 40 minute ordeal with half of our party missing the start of Star Wars 3D. Food items were coming up and they were yelling out names, and then the items were sitting there getting cold. People eventually started grabbing items that weren't theirs. Once the food was ready, it was difficult to carry back through 2 sets of doors into the theater - we asked an employee to open the door and he refused until we practically begged him. Then he walked away without opening the second set of doors. Ugh.\n\nOnce inside the theater you realize that while the recliners are very comfortable, they are not designed with any sort of table or surface to put your food items on besides a drink holder in the arm rest. So now you are trying to balance your food items on your lap. Ackward.\n\nThe other issue is the very limited and unimaginative menu. Corn dogs, hot dogs, pizza, nachos - that kind of stuff.

The theater lobby was packed!  I had thought of buying my ticket online and paying the $1 service fee, but then decided that if I couldn't choose my seats online (like I can on iPic's website), then I'll just take my chances and buy the ticket at the theater.  There are several kiosks available where you may purchase tickets so that you don't have to line up at the registers.  I am not certain that you may punch in your code into these kiosks to claim your ticket passes-- all I know is that theater reps were telling people in line to \"get your confirmation codes ready\" for presentation at the register lines.  Since there was only one seat available for the 7:20 3D showing of SW (all the way in the front), I asked for the 8:10 showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 3D, which only had two, or three seats available, and I chose one in the C aisle, towards the middle.\n\nWhile one Yelp reviewer lamented that he and his girlfriend were disappointed in learning that this theater doesn't offer \"in-theater service,\" I applaud Harkin's decision to keep distractions down!  I rarely watch movies at Studio Movie Grill now, because of the servers constantly walking in front of me, and I do not want to hear audience members placing their meal orders while I'm trying to watch the movie.  Also, certain food odors can make me feel ill.  In-theater service seemed like a great idea to me in the beginning, but there are too many negatives for me to appreciate it.  I'd rather dine elsewhere and then go to the movies!  I am happy to read here that I'm able to take a glass of wine, or anything else I may enjoy from the bar Verite Lounge, be it coffee from CARTEL [1], or ice cream from LA GRANDE ORANGE [1] into the auditorium!  With all the grand opening commotion (lines for tickets, lines to get photographed with stormtroopers, lines to order at Verite), I had not the time to find this out myself.  \n\nThere are 14 rooms equipped with lounge chairs that recline.  Yes, ALL of the chairs recline!  Which explains why ticket prices start at $14.  3D tickets are $17.  Dan Harkins, the eldest son of Dwight \"Red\" Harkins, was there to welcome us at the 8:10 showing.  He said we were the first to sit at these chairs to watch the first showing of Star Wars-- the first half of that sentence I believed, since we probably were the first to watch anything played in auditorium #14, but the second half confused me, since I had passed up on seeing the 7:20 pm showing of SW, but I let it slide.  It was nice to listen to Dan Harkins, who took over the company, which was in \"near bankruptcy\" in 1974, when his father passed away.  (His father opened College Theatre in 1940, now called Harkins Valley Art, and Camelview 5 in 1973.  All biographical info I'm including here is according to Wikipedia.)  Do you know that there are currently 30 Harkins locations in five states (Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and California)?  \n\nPrices are a bit steep [2], but I really enjoyed the two and a half hours I spent lying on that lounge chair, and I was suffering from sinus headaches the whole time!  The front area of the auditorium had a lot of space, but I found aisle C to be a little too close.[3]  I'll have to check out the chairs behind and update my opinion on this.  I hope to try a cup of coffee and some ice cream on my next trip, as well!\n\n[1] From the mouth of Dan Harkins himself!  \n[2] Seniors and children may avail of the $6 discount on movies that start before 6 pm.\n[3] You may choose your seats online at harkins.com!  There's a $1 convenience fee per ticket, but it's worth it.  Otherwise, you may save a little extra cash and take your chances by waiting in line and then choosing your seats at the register.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QNZTXlE9XY3HyZO3kx6eew"}

The theater is located at the Northeast end of Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and you can enter from the mall or directly from the parking garage on the North side of the mall. The theater itself is very nice. The lobby includes seating areas, a bar with dessert selections, an outdoor patio, customer service, and a concession stand with standard movie fare like popcorn, sodas, and candies. What it is not is a movie theater with waiter service where they deliver food and drinks to your seat and that's fine with me, I've been to those places and while the waiters are usually fairly discreet, the other patrons trying to flag them down, pick up and put down their food, or sending back orders is what is generally very annoying. If you want dinner and movie that's fine, but do it somewhere else!\n\nAs for the theater experience itself, it was amazing! First of all, there is reserved seating so you can select where you want to sit and know it will be available. Secondly, the screens are curved for optimal viewing and the sound quality is amazing. Finally, the seats recline... and this isn't just leaning back, it's motorized loungers with footrests that come out and backs that go back so far you're almost lying down. In fact, the only drawback I can foresee is that because this theater will be showing art films, and the average age of the audience at those films is fairly old, it's quite possible that some people may find themselves falling asleep or sitting next to a snorer in this theater. \n\nOverall though, this is an amazing place to see a movie and a worthy successor to the original Camelview. Once again we should be grateful that we have a chain like Harkins based in the Valley which provides us with great options for moviegoing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QNZTXlE9XY3HyZO3kx6eew"}

But I'm pretty sure you need to get a ticket to get in. \n\nRefreshments as you would normally see any other Harkins theater.  Difference is there's Liquor here...yay!\n\nCoolest thing about the theater is you have seats you get to pick yourself before you even get in.  This is good so you never have to wait in a line to get a good seat.  Once your inside, every seat is leather and electrically reclinable.  Leather chairs, popcorn and a beer or 2?

I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.\n   The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.  \nWe got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.  \n    Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.

My mother-in-law wanted to take her sandwich. I asked the woman sweeping where I can get a to go box. She stopped and stared at me for a few seconds like how dare I bother her.

No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window.  You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah?  It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.\n\nAll of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random place while I go to work.  \n\nStep 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call them and make an appointment.  Taking a strange dog into a place full of dogs is a little dicey.  Typically, new dogs are brought over on Saturday (when there are no other dogs around) so Barbara can get a sense of its temperament.  Barbara is great with dogs and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \"well, if my kid isn't good enough for them, screw them!\" thoughts running through my head.  Obviously, Barbara instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.\n\nStep 2: learn to let go.  I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare.  The first few times, they scream and cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day.  Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow WoW) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom.  It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud.  See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?\n\nBow Wow separates the dogs by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the dogs don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress.  The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your dog's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your dog's socialization and adjustment.  I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \"Is he playing?  Is he making friends?\" on a daily basis.  The entire staff was very good about humoring me.\n\nGus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.

I made the terrible mistake to lease a vehicle for the first time and it's not the lease I regret, it's where I leased from: Infiniti on Camelback aka hell on earth. \n\nMy brand new car immediately broke and was without AC in the dead of summer which resulted in my car being at the dealership for three weeks! Both (the time frame for fixing and the breaking of the AC itself) were \"flukes\" and \"not typical\" of infiniti, yeah ok. Fine. They fixed it, so I thought! \n\nThe dual temperature feature on my car no longer worked. 60 degrees and 79 degrees are the same temperature. Any range in between is the same as well. It's either just cold or above 80 degrees. I explain this, am told it will be taken care of then to my surprise I go to get my car and they say everything is fine. They did nothing. \n\nI explain to the random service guy what the now unfixed issue is, he sits in the car twirls some knobs and confirms what I'm saying. He then goes to the dipshit manager who can't wrap his head around the issue and says ,\"why would you have the AC on of its set at 89 degrees?\"  \n\nI admit at this point I wanted to smack his pensive face and needed to remove myself from the irritating scenario.  It was evident that his intellectual shortcomings were not going to change today so I again left with a partially working overpriced car. \n\nInfinities are nice cars, just not mine. \nAvoid Infiniti on camelback if you want a positive experience.\n\np.s. They claimed that they rotated my tires yet the service light still remains on, they can't even handle that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hhUKRAIkS-vlBtt17DqmNg"}

Some back story, I own a 2008 g35x with an ally premium warranty.\n\nTook my car to the dealer due to wheel noise and rough idle. The vehicle had both front wheel bearings and both valve covers replaced within my warranty.  The dealership handled the legwork with the insurance company and set me up with a 2015 qx60 loan vehicle.\n\nThe repairs were quick, Shelby in particular was professional and friendly, and most importantly the overall experience from driving my car into the service department to leaving with my car was simple and easy.\n\n5 out of 5 stars for sure, I will get all of my service done here from now on, and possibly a new q50 when the time comes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hhUKRAIkS-vlBtt17DqmNg"}
